Unlike the process based LCA that suffers system truncation, the integrated hybrid LCA supplements the truncated system with a comprehensive economic input-output system. Compared with the economic input output-based LCA that loses accuracy from process aggregation, the integrated hybrid LCA retains the precision in modeling major unit processes within the well-to-wire system boundary. Three environmental categories, namely, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, and energy consumption, are considered. Based on this integrated hybrid LCA framework, we further developed an integrated hybrid life cycle optimization model, which enables automatic identification of sustainable alternatives in the design and operations of shale gas supply chains. We applied the model to a well-to-wire shale gas supply chain in the UK to illustrate the applicability. According to the optimization results, the lowest levelized cost of electricity generated from shale gas is (sic)51.8/MWh, and the optimal life cycle GHG emissions, water consumption, and energy consumption are 473.5 kg CO2-eq/MWh, 2263 kg/MWh, and 1009 MJ/MWh, respectively.\",\"[Gao, Jiyao; You, Fengqi] Cornell Univ, Robert Frederick Smith Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA\",\"You, FQ (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Robert Frederick Smith Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.\",fengqi.you@cornell.edu,\"You, Fengqi/B-5040-2011\",\"You, Fengqi/0000-0001-9609-4299\",National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award [CBET-1643244],The authors acknowledge financial support from National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award (CBET-1643244).,,76.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,\"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA\",2168-0485,,,ACS SUSTAIN CHEM ENG,ACS Sustain.

This article proposes principles and strategies for designing future international law to attain health and common good objectives. Argument: Basic principles are needed for international trade and investment agreements that are consistent with the common good, public health, and human rights. These principles should reflect the importance of reducing inequalities, along with social and environmental sustainability. Economic growth should be recognised as a means to common good objectives, rather than an end in itself. Our favoured approach is both radical and comprehensive: we describe what this approach would include and outline the strategies for its implementation, the processes and capacity building necessary for its achievement, and related governance and corporate issues. The comprehensive approach includes significant changes to current models for trade and investment agreements, in particular (i) health, social and environmental objectives would be recognised as legitimate in their own right and implemented accordingly; (ii) changes to dispute resolution processes, both state-to-state and investor-state; (iii) greater deference to international legal frameworks for health, environmental protection, and human rights; (iv) greater coherence across the international law framework; (v) limitations on investor privileges, and (vi) enforceable corporate responsibilities for contributing to health, environmental, human rights and other common good objectives. We also identify some limited changes that could be considered as an alternative to the proposed comprehensive approach. Future research is needed to develop a range of model treaties, and on the means by which such treaties and reforms might be achieved. Such research would focus also on complementary institutional reforms relevant to the United Nations and other international agencies. Advocacy by a range of communities is needed for effective change. Reform will require informed debate, determined engagement with decision-makers and stakeholders, and some agreement across health, social and environmental sectors on alternatives. Conclusions: Current frameworks of international law that govern trade and economic development need radical change, in relation to treaty processes, content, and contexts, to better attain public health objectives.\",\"[Delany, Louise; Signal, Louise; Thomson, George] Univ Otago, Box 7343, Wellington, New Zealand\",\"Thomson, G (reprint author), Univ Otago, Box 7343, Wellington, New Zealand.\",George.thomson@otago.ac.nz,,,University of Otago Research Grant,\"Partial funding was received from a University of Otago Research Grant.

The paper presents a conceptual framework and typology to assess watershed ecological restoration based on the properties and processes of sustainable watershed development. According to multiple life stages, habitat properties and existing legal frameworks and applicable valuation approaches, the bio-indicator that integrates natural, political and socio-economic dimensions is proposed. With existing assessment results and official web-pages as references, evaluation systems concerning human impacts on aquatic systems are set forth. Suitable aquatic bio-indicators can standardize the monitoring methodology with respect to water quality, organic pollutants and pesticides, generation time, migration ability, saprobic status, taxonomic composition and diversity. A large number of fish-based indexes have been developed to monitor and manage river ecosystems.

This paper focuses on the role of community-based entrepreneurship in protecting and managing the natural environment that impacts directly life quality of local residents, as social and natural systems manifest and evolve in a dynamic interdependence. We apply a case study methodology to capture the richness of community-based entrepreneurship and evidence the diversity of these initiatives. By presenting and analyzing three case studies on different types of environmentally-driven initiatives - considering the natural environment as an object, context or resource of entrepreneurial activities, we identify the main elements of community entrepreneurship and the factors influencing its manifestations. These elements are integrated into a synthetic model, which maps the relationships between various components and success factors of environmentally-driven community initiatives. Our findings provide a better understanding of community-based entrepreneurship and of the hidden mechanisms of collective initiative and action.\",\"[Gurau, Calin; Dana, Leo-Paul] Princeton Univ, Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier Res Management, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier, France\",\"Dana, LP (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier Res Management, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier, France.\",c.gurau@montpellier-bs.com; lp.dana@Montpellier-BS.com,,,,,,58.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,\"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA\",0040-1625,1873-5509,,TECHNOL FORECAST SOC,Technol.

Invertebrate biomass and abundance were significantly greater in 2006 than in 1970-1974 primarily due to high nuculid (Bivalvia) biomass and abundance that contributed 13.2% (biomass) and 8.5% (abundance) to differences in community structure between the sampling periods. This is in contrast to St. Lawrence Island Polynya studies conducted in the 1980s and 1990s that documented decreases in benthic biomass and abundance.

The equilibrium Hg concentrations are very similar in octane and dodecane, reaching values of 821 ppm and 647 ppm, respectively at 200 degrees C, whereas they are significantly lower in toluene (e.g., 280 ppm at 200 degrees C). The behavior of Hg in toluene is nevertheless similar to that in the alkanes. There is a strong prograde dependence of Hg concentration on temperature in both types of solvent, which can be described by the following experimentally determined relationships: Dodecane: Log(X-Hg) = -1943.1/T[K] + 0.8884 Octane: Log(X-Hg) = -2346.3/T[K] + 1.6017 Toluene: Log(X-Hg) = -2768.3/T[K] + 1.9726 The solubility of metallic mercury can be modeled satisfactorily using a modification of the scaled particle theory designed to predict the behavior of nonpolar solutes in polar solvents. This modification involves an adjustment of the Lennard Jones Potential and the hard-sphere diameters of solute and solvent to account for the effects of temperature. The results of this study suggest that hydrocarbons could play a significant role in transporting Hg in natural systems, which may explain the high concentrations of metallic mercury in some crude oils, as well as the common occurrence of petroleum in epithermal mercury deposits.

As an important tool of predicting and preventing these problems, water-environmental risk assessment (WERA) plays an increasingly important role in environment management. This study mainly targets the surface water environment and takes the BTH region as a study area in developing a water-environmental risk assessment index system based on the Driving force-Pressures-States-Impacts-Responses model. The weighting, risk, and zoning of each index are determined using multiple methods such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, and geographic information system technology. Further discussions are made to analyze the leading factors of high-risk units, the relationship between the risk level and social economy, and the uncertainty of WERA. Generally speaking, results show that the relative high-risk areas mainly distribute in Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and Tangshan, and the relative low-risk areas mainly distribute in Chengde and Zhangjiakou. The remaining parts of the region are at the middle-risk level. The results also show a positive correlation between the risk level and the social economy. This study gathered lots of data and carried out a number of calculation work, and is expected to improve the WERA methods and help managers set the priorities for local water-environmental management and make more effective decisions in the context of BTH collaborative development.\",\"[Leng, Suya; Zhai, Yuanzheng; Jiang, Shijie; Lei, Yan; Wang, Jinsheng] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Minist Educ China, Engn Res Ctr Groundwater Pollut Control & Remedia, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China\",\"Zhai, YZ (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Minist Educ China, Engn Res Ctr Groundwater Pollut Control & Remedia, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.\",diszyz@163.com,,,CRSRI Open Research Program [CKWV2015235/KY]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41302179]; Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [2014ZX07201-010],\"This work was funded by the CRSRI Open Research Program(CKWV2015235/KY) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41302179).

Enhance Fitness (EF) is an evidence-based group exercise program delivered by community-based organizations. The purpose of this study was to review recent evidence on the dissemination and implementation of EF. Methods: A scoping review of qualitative and quantitative studies with EF as main focus was conducted. CINAHL, PubMed, PubMed Central, SCOPUS, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar were searched between October and November 2015 for data-based studies on EF published in 2010-2015. Two team members abstracted each paper independently using a data abstraction tool. Results were summarized using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Results: Seventeen publications met inclusion criteria. EF has reached and is effective across a broad population base, including individuals with low SES and diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds. EF participation may be associated with reduced risk for falls requiring medical care, and is associated with fewer hospital admissions. Analyses of medical cost savings from EF participation and program implementation costs suggest economic benefits of EF implementation for communities. Organization-level maintenance is facilitated by program-specific and organizational factors, such as instructor training and funding. Individual-level maintenance is facilitated by program structure, absence of pain, and increased quality of life. Conclusions: More-rigorous evidence is needed about the association between participation in EF and conditions such as falls. Evaluation of program fidelity, adaptations, and sustainability is limited; more-systematic examination across population groups and types of organizations would help ensure older adults continue to benefit from EF participation.

As economic and ideational globalization accelerate, fisheries are becoming more globally connected via movements of fish products and fisheries finances, information, and stakeholders throughout the world. As such, there is a pressing need for systematic approaches to assess these linkages among global fisheries, their effects on ecosystems and food security, and their implications for fisheries science and sustainability. Use of the telecoupling framework is a novel and insightful method to systematically evaluate socioeconomic and environmental interactions among CHANS. We apply the telecoupling framework to the Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) fishery, the world's largest single-species commercial fishery and a complex CHANS. The anchoveta fishery has diverse and significant telecouplings, socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances, with the rest of the world, including fishmeal and fish oil trade, monetary flow, knowledge transfer, and movement of people. The use of the telecoupling framework reveals complex fishery dynamics such as feedbacks (e.g., profit maximization causing fishery overcapitalization) and surprises (e.g., stock collapse) resulting from local and long-distance ecological and socioeconomic interactions. The Peruvian anchoveta fishery illustrates how the telecoupling framework can be used to systematically assess the magnitude and diversity of local and distant fisheries interactions and thereby advance knowledge derived from traditional monothematic research approaches. Insights from the telecoupling framework provide a foundation from which to develop sustainable fisheries policy and management strategies across local, national, and international levels in a globalized world.\",\"[Carlson, Andrew K.; Taylor, William W.; Liu, Jianguo; Orlic, Ivan] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Carlson, Andrew K.; Taylor, William W.; Liu, Jianguo] Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA\",\"Carlson, AK (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.; Carlson, AK (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.\",,,,\"U.S. National Science Foundation; Michigan State University, Michigan AgBioResearch; National Institutes of Health, National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Guggenheim Foundation\",\"We thank the institutions that provided funding for previous telecoupling research on which this manuscript is based: U.S. National Science Foundation, Michigan State University, Michigan AgBioResearch, National Institutes of Health, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Guggenheim Foundation.

Place of residence is generally used to assess neighbourhood exposure. Yet, because people are mobile, multiple exposures should be accounted for to assess the relation between food environments and overweight. Unfortunately, mobility data is often missing from health surveys. We hereby test the feasibility of linking travel survey data with food listings to derive food store exposure predictors of overweight among health survey participants. Methods: Food environment exposure measures accounting for non-residential activity places (activity spaces) were computed and modelled in Montreal and Quebec City, Canada, using travel surveys and food store listings. Models were then used to predict activity space food exposures for 5,578 participants of the Canadian Community Health Survey. These food exposure estimates, accounting for daily mobility, were used to model self-reported overweight in a multilevel framework. Median Odd Ratios were used to assess the proportion of between-neighborhood variance explained by such food exposure predictors. Results: Estimates of food environment exposure accounting for both residential and non-residential destinations were significantly and more strongly associated with overweight than residential-only measures of exposure for men. For women, residential exposures were more strongly associated with overweight than non-residential exposures. In Montreal, adjusted models showed men in the highest quartile of exposure to food stores were at lesser risk of being overweight considering exposure to restaurants (OR = 0.36 [0.21-0.62]), fast food outlets (0.48 [0.30-0.79]), or corner stores (0.52 [0.35-0.78]). Conversely, men experiencing the highest proportion of restaurants being fast-food outlets were at higher risk of being overweight (2.07 [1.25-3.42]). Women experiencing higher residential exposures were at lower risk of overweight. Conclusion: Using residential neighbourhood food exposure measures may underestimate true exposure and observed associations.

To assess the reliability of different strategies along the food supply chain, a measure of food cost through the environmental impact protein content binomial is necessary. This study proposes a standardized method to calculate the Green Protein Footprint (GPF) index, a method that assesses both the environmental impact of a food product and its protein content provided to consumers. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to calculate the environmental impact of the selected food products, and a Life Cycle Protein Assessment (LCPA) was performed by accounting for the protein content along the supply chain. Although the GPF can be applied to all food chain products, this paper is focused on European anchovy-based products for indirect human consumption (fishmeal) and for direct human consumption (fresh, salted and canned anchovies). Moreover, the circular economy concept was applied considering the valorization of the anchovy residues generated during the canning process. These residues were used to produce fishmeal, which was employed in bass aquaculture. Hence, humans are finally consuming fish protein from the residues, closing the loop of the original product life cycle. More elaborated, multi-ingredient food products (salted and canned anchovy products), presented higher GPF values due to higher environmental impacts. Furthermore, the increase of food loss throughout their life cycle caused a decrease in the protein content. Regarding salted and canned products, the packaging was the main hotspot. The influence of the packaging was evaluated using the GPF, reaffirming that plastic was the best alternative. These results highlighted the importance of improving packaging materials in food products.\",\"[Laso, Jara; Margallo, Maria; Serrano, Maria; Irabien, Angel; Aldaco, Ruben] Univ Cantabria, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Avda Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Vazquez-Rowe, Ian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Peruvian LCA Network, Dept Engn, Av Univ 1801, Lima 15088, Peru; [Avadi, Angel] CIRAD, UPR Recyclage & Risque, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Fullana, Pere; Bala, Alba] UPF, ESCI, UNESCO Chair Life Cycle & Climate Change, Pg Pujades 1, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Gazulla, Cristina] Lavola Cosostenibilidad, Rbla Catalunya 6, Barcelona 08007, Spain\",\"Laso, J (reprint author), Univ Cantabria, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Avda Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain.\",jara.laso@unican.es,\"Irabien, Angel/I-4395-2014\",\"Irabien, Angel/0000-0002-2411-4163; Vazquez-Rowe, Ian/0000-0002-7469-2033; Bala Gala, Alba/0000-0002-5501-1140\",\"Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of the Spanish Government [CTM2013-43539-R, CTM 2016-76176-C2-1-R]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spanish Government [BES-2014-069368]\",The authors thank the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of the Spanish Government for their financial support via the projects GeSAC-Conserva: Sustainable Management of the Cantabrian Anchovies (CTM2013-43539-R) and CERES_Project: Food Production strategies for climate change mitigation: towards a food circular economy (CTM 2016-76176-C2-1-R).

Agent-based modelling is one approach that allows explicit modelling of human decision-making processes, providing a way of simulating both the social and economic components. When coupled with biophysical process models, they become powerful tools to explore two-way human-environment interactions. However, this approach is not without challenges. Modellers need to work out how to incorporate factors such as incomplete information, multiple goals, trust, loyalty and emotions, how to link agent-based models to existing biophysical models, and how to deal with the inevitable complexity of the models that result. New ways of validating these models also need to be developed as, unlike most biophysical models, there are moral and cost restraints on designing and manipulating experimentally SESs containing humans. There is also a need to ensure the relevance of the models by involving appropriate stakeholders in their development.\",\"Macaulay Inst, Integrated Land Use Grp, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland\",\"Matthews, R (reprint author), Macaulay Inst, Integrated Land Use Grp, Craigiebuckler, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.\",robin.matthews@bbsrc.ac.uk,\"Matthews, Robin/E-7975-2013\",,,,\"Allison H.

Long lifetimes, high money costs and resource-intensity, and the rippling effects of the built environment on all aspects of daily life call for informed public conversation about the available choices before they become a fait accompli. Substantial literatures address the phenomenon in terms of economic development, resource scarcities, impacts on climate and ecosystems, technological options, human rights, funding sources, system governance, inter-governmental agreements. This paper describes a modeling framework that integrates some of these concerns about the differential impacts of large-scale centralized infrastructure systems, smaller-scale decentralized systems, and hybrid combinations. Building on existing collaborations between economists and engineers, the paper proposes a case-study research strategy to organize new types of technical information to supplement existing databases of the world economy. The paper describes needed model extensions to estimate money costs, resource requirements, resource recovery potential, and jobs and livelihoods under alternative infrastructure assumptions. The agenda supports the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by identifying and evaluating globally relevant alternative infrastructure designs.

Different strategies have been employed to promote couple HIV testing and counselling (CHTC). Despite this, HIV incidence among couples continues to rise. This study sought to assess the use of a counsellor-supported disclosure (CSD) model in enhancing the uptake of CHTC and the factors that were associated with it. Methods: A pre-post quasi experimental study design with an intervention and a comparison arm was utilized. The study was conducted in Nairobi, Nakuru, Kisumu, and Homa Bay counties in Kenya. A total of 276 participants were recruited; 149 and 127 in the comparison and intervention arms, respectively. Standard HIV testing & counselling (HTC) was offered in the comparison arm whereas the counsellor-supported disclosure model was administered in the intervention arm. The model empowered index clients to invite their sexual partner for CHTC. Telephone follow-up and subsequent community health volunteer (CHV) follow-up for non-responders were embedded in the model. Semi-structured questionnaires were used to collect data at baseline and 3 months into the study. In-depth interviews were conducted with 15 participants who took up the intervention and 7 of the HTC providers who offered CSD. The quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using STATA version 13 and NVIVO 10, respectively. Results: Uptake of CHTC was 28% in the intervention arm of the study compared to 7% in the comparison arm (p < 0.001). Participants in the intervention arm of the study had eight times higher odds of taking up CHTC compared to their counterparts. The outcome of the qualitative interviews revealed that the CSD counselling, skills on partner invitation, and follow-up for partner invitation increased the uptake of CHTC. On the other hand, unwillingness to test together with partner, lack of availability to test together as a couple, and provision of the wrong contact information by the participants reduced the uptake of CHTC. Conclusion: The CSD model improved the uptake of CHTC. This model can be integrated into the existing HTC structures to enhance the uptake of CHTC.\",\"[Kababu, Margaret; Karuga, Robinson; Ikahu, Annrita; Njeri, Inviolata; Kyongo, Jordan; Mukoma, Wanjiru] LVCT Hlth, Nairobi, Kenya; [Sakwa, Eric] Root Capital, Nairobi, Kenya; [Khamali, Catherine] Trocaire, Nairobi, Kenya\",\"Kababu, M (reprint author), LVCT Hlth, Nairobi, Kenya.\",Margaret.Kababu@lvcthealth.org,,,Trocaire [KEN 1201-05],\"This study was funded by Trocaire (Project Reference No: KEN 1201-05).

A more sustainable waste policy solution than landfill is energy-from-waste (EfW). The governmentality perspective suggests that, to achieve such policy ends, compliance is required from a range of actors who operate at a distance from central states. This paper is the first to draw together theoretical comparisons of Western neoliberal and Chinese governmentality in the context of waste governance. We find that long-standing liberal approaches to power and policy-making witnessed in the UK have parallels with a hybrid mix of socialist governance and Chinese governmentality. Beijing seeks to govern not via neoliberal tactics of 'freedom and liberty', but rather through a distinct planning and administrative rationality. Our comparative case study approach allows us to illustrate the dual facilitative and authoritarian dimensions to 'top-down' compliance given 'bottom-up' counter claims of expertise by citizen scientists and other activists in local communities. This analysis in turn reveals how power plays out between state actors, corporations and local communities in these two different political and planning systems. We suggest that the progressive development of lay expertise in environmental health risks is a dynamic marker of the limits to the top-down imposition of waste policy in both countries. Our approach to comparative analysis draws attention to the need to revisit approaches to neoliberal Western governmentality and to extend empirical investigations using illiberal Chinese governmentality.

The telecoupling framework gains its distinction by enabling researchers to dive deeply into systemic complexities, even if systems are far away from each other. It is also ambitious in its aim to meet challenges unencumbered by disciplines. To understand the forces affecting sustainability across local to global scales, it is essential to build a comprehensive set of spatially explicit tools for describing and quantifying multiple reciprocal socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances. We introduce the Telecoupling Toolbox, the first set of tools developed to map and identify the five major interrelated components of the telecoupling framework: systems, flows, agents, causes, and effects. The modular design of the toolbox allows the integration of existing tools and software to assess synergies and trade-offs associated with policies and other local to global interventions. We show applications of the toolbox by using two representative telecoupling case studies that address a variety of socioeconomic and environmental issues. The results suggest that the toolbox can systematically map and quantify multiple telecouplings under various contexts while providing users with an easy-to-use interface. It is our hope that the innovative, free, and open-source toolbox can provide a useful platform to address globally important issues, such as land use and land cover change, species invasion, migration, flows of ecosystem services, and trade of goods and products.\",\"[Tonini, Francesco; Liu, Jianguo] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA\",\"Tonini, F (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.\",,,,National Science Foundation; NASA; NIH; Michigan State University; Michigan AgBioResearch,\"We are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their constructive and helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper.

In this process CO2 may be trapped in stable carbonate minerals and may thereby be immobilized for long time spans. The potential for mineral trapping can be estimated by solving kinetic expressions for the reservoir minerals and possible secondary phases. This is, however, not trivial as kinetic data are uncertain or even lacking for the minerals of interest. Here, the rate equations most commonly used for CO2 storage simulations have been solved, and the rate parameters varied, to obtain sensitivity on the total amount of CO2 stored as mineral carbonate. As various expressions are in use to estimate growth rates of secondary carbonates, three formulations were compared, including one taking into account mineral nucleation preceding growth. The sensitivity studies were done on two systems, the Utsira Sand being representative for a cold quartz-rich sand (37 degrees C, 100 bar CO2), and the Gulf Coast Sediment, being representative for a medium temperature quartz-plagioclase-rich system (75 degrees C, 300 bar CO2). The simulations showed that the total predicted CO2 mineral storage is especially sensitive to the choice of growth rate model and the reactive surface area. The largest sensitivity was found on a, fraction of total surface area available for reactions, with a reduction of one order of magnitude for all reacting phases leading to 3-4 times lower predicted CO2 mineral storage. Because the reactive surface area is highly uncertain for natural systems, the range in predicted results may be even larger. The short-term predictions (<100-1000 a), such as the onset of carbonate growth, were highly sensitive to nucleation and growth rates. Moreover, the type of carbonate minerals formed was shown to be model dependent, with the simplest model predicting an unlikely carbonate assemblage at low temperature (i.e., formation of dolomite at 37 degrees C). Therefore, to use kinetic models to upscale short-term (<months) laboratory experiments in time, to identify the past reactions and physical conditions of natural CO2 storage analogues, and finally to predict the potential for CO2 trapping in existing and future storage projects, more knowledge has to be collected, especially on the reactive surface area of CO2 storage reservoirs, and on the rate of secondary carbonate nucleation and growth.

Among the prime external forcings is the solar radiation, while the human activity is included among the principal intrinsic forcings. This means that basic components of nature and society are substantial parameters of the evolution of the climate system. Therefore, the consideration of the nature and society as a separate system, the nature-society system, will provide a new tool for the investigation of the climate system variability. This paper is focused on the modelling of the evolution of the nature-society system, when considering a series of major natural and anthropogenic processes including several solar-terrestrial coupling mechanisms, biogeochemical cycles, physical processes operating in the terrestrial atmosphere, global climate change, global hydrologic balance and photosynthesis in ocean ecosystems. Among the main goals of this model is to estimate the survivability of the nature-society system under the conditions of limited energy resources. A series of simulation experiments are presented herein demonstrating the ability of the model to operate satisfactorily and reliably under various anthropogenic scenarios.\",\"[Krapivin, Vladimir F.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Radioengn & Elect, Vvedensky Sq 1, Fryazino 141190, Moscow Region, Russia; [Varotsos, Costas A.] Univ Athens, Fac Phys, Dept Appl Phys, Lab Upper Air, Athens, Greece\",\"Varotsos, CA (reprint author), Univ Athens, Fac Phys, Dept Appl Phys, Lab Upper Air, Athens, Greece.\",covar@phys.uoa.gr,,\"Varotsos, Costas/0000-0001-7215-3610\",,,,65.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,\"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS\",2211-4645,2211-4653,,ENVIRON DEV,Environ.

Meanwhile, as non-electric energy accounts for over 60% of total water consumption in the energy supply sector, it is vital to understand future water trends in the context of decarbonization. However, few studies have focused on life-cycle water impacts for non-electric energy; besides, applying conventional LCA methodology to assess non-electric energy has limitations. In this paper, a MultiRegional Hybrid Life-Cycle Assessment (MRHLCA) model is built to assess total CO2 emissions and water consumption of 6 non-electric energy technologies - transport energy from biofuel and gasoline, heat supply from natural gas, biogas, coal, and residual biomass, within 7 major emitting economies. We find that a shift to natural gas and residual biomass heating can help economies reduce 14-65% CO2 and save more than 21% water. However, developed and developing economies should take differentiated technical strategies. Then we apply scenarios from IMAGE model to demonstrate that if economies take cost-effective 2 degrees C pathways, the water conservation synergy for the whole energy supply sector, including electricity, can also be achieved.\",\"[Liu, Shiyuan; Wang, Can; Shi, Lei] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shiyuan; Wang, Can; Cai, Wenjia] Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modelling, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lixiao] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China\",\"Wang, C (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.\",canwang@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China project [2017YFA0603602]; special fund of State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control [17L02ESPC],This study was financially supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China project (No. 2017YFA0603602) and the special fund of State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control (No. 17L02ESPC).

Members of this order are abundant in diverse marine environments, frequently accounting for as much as 25% of the total bacterial community. Conservation of the genes encoding GTAs allows their use as diagnostic markers of Rhodobacterales in biogeographical studies. The first survey of the diversity of Rhodobacterales based on the GTA major capsid gene was conducted in a warm temperate estuarine ecosystem, the Chesapeake Bay, but the biogeography of Rhodobacterales has not been explored extensively. This study investigates Rhodobacterales diversity in the cold subarctic water near Newfoundland, Canada. Our results suggest that the subarctic region of the North Atlantic contains diverse Rhodobacterales communities in both winter and summer, and that the diversity of the Rhodobacterales community in the summer Newfoundland coastal water is higher than that found in the Chesapeake Bay, in either the summer or winter. Approximately one-third of GTA sequences retrieved from the subarctic waters were most closely related to those from bacteria isolated from sea ice or cold regions. Distinguishable diversity patterns were found between the temperate and subarctic waters, providing further support for niche adaptation of specific Rhodobacterales members to unique environments. We also demonstrate that a number of Rhodobacterales strains, from both the subarctic and temperate locations, express the GTA major capsid protein. This provides robust evidence that the widespread conservation of GTA genes in the Rhodobacterales may result in the production of functionally similar and active GTA systems in these bacteria in different environments.\",\"[Fu, Yunyun; MacLeod, Dawne M.; Lang, Andrew S.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada; [Rivkin, Richard B.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Ctr Ocean Sci, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada; [Chen, Feng] Univ Maryland, Ctr Marine Biotechnol, Inst Biotechnol, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA; [Buchan, Alison] Univ Tennessee, Dept Microbiol, Knoxville, TN 37914 USA\",\"Lang, AS (reprint author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, 232 Elizabeth Ave, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada.\",aslang@mun.ca,\"Chen, Feng/P-3088-2014\",\"Lang, Andrew/0000-0002-4510-7683\",Memorial University of Newfoundland; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC); Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI); Government of Newfoundland; Labrador; U.S. National Science Foundation,\"We thank K.

Contaminant levels in Great Lakes fish communities have been closely monitored over the last few decades, and the resulting information has been indispensable in guiding consumption advisories. In this study, we first conducted an analysis of temporal trends of three organochlorines (hexachlorobenzene, octachlorostyrene, and alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane) in five Lake Erie fish species using dynamic linear modeling, while explicitly considering fish length and lipid content as covariates. Our results indicate that the levels of the three compounds have been steadily decreasing during the late 1970s to 2007, although there were instances in which the fish organochlorine contents exhibited fluctuations through time. The second part of our analysis focused on the development of a Bayesian framework to update fish consumption advisories. We present a methodology that incorporates the uncertainty in contaminant predictions and the natural variability in fish length and lipid content, while remaining flexible for different human weights and diet patterns. We then illustrate our Bayesian framework for two important contaminants in the Great Lakes region, mercury and PCBs. We established thresholds for each contaminant based on the tolerable daily intake (TDI) values and made predictive statements about the probability of exceedance of these critical levels. Our study also discusses how failure to account for model uncertainty/error can have profound implications for the credibility of the predictive risk assessment statements derived. The proposed Bayesian approach to fish consumption advisories can serve as a valuable framework for year-specific, highly customizable risk assessment statements that also account for the inherent variability in natural systems.

Given the continuing epidemic of obesity, policymakers are increasingly looking for levers within the local retail food environment as a means of promoting healthy weights. Purpose. To examine the independent and joint associations of absolute and relative densities of restaurants near home with weight status in a large, urban, population-based sample of adults. Methods. We studied 10,199 adults living in one of four cities in southern Ontario, Canada, who participated in the Canadian Community Health Survey (cycles 2005, 2007/08, 2009/10). Multivariate models assessed the association of weight status (obesity and body mass index) with absolute densities (numbers) of fast-food, full-service and other restaurants, and the relative density (proportion) of fast-food restaurants (FFR) relative to all restaurants within - 10-minute walk of residential areas. Results. Higher numbers of restaurants of any type were inversely related to excess weight, even in models adjusting for a range of individual covariates and area deprivation. However, these associations were no longer significant after accounting for higher walkability of areas with high volumes of restaurants. In contrast, there was a direct relationship between the proportion of FFR relative to all restaurants and excess weight, particularly in areas with high volumes of FFR (e.g., odds ratio for obesity = 2.55 in areas with 5 + FFR, 95% confidence interval: 1.55-4.17, across the interquartile range). Conclusions. Policies aiming to promote healthy weights that target the volume of certain retail food outlets in residential settings may be more effective if they also consider the relative share of outlets serving more and less healthful foods.

Here we characterize the genetic causes of trade-offs generating local adaptation in populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens that had previously been evolved for specialization on three different carbon resources. We measured the fitness effects of mutations that arose during selection in that environment and in alternative environments to quantify the degree of specialization. We find that all mutations are beneficial in the environment of selection and that those arising later during adaptation are associated with increasingly antagonistic effects in alternative environments compared with those arising earlier, consistent with a multioptima version of Fisher's geometric model of adaptation. We also find that fitness of pairs of beneficial mutations are consistently less than additive in selection environments, producing a pattern of diminishing returns, but are more variable in alternative environments, being either positive or negative. Finally, we find that mutations in genes associated with loss of motility are beneficial across all environments, whereas mutations involving other functions, such as gene regulation, had more variable effects, being more environment specific. Taken together, these results provide a detailed account of the genetics of specialization and suggest that the evolution of trade-offs associated with local adaptation may often result from the antagonistic effects of beneficial mutations substituted later in adaptation.\",\"[Schick, Alana; Kassen, Rees] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Schick, Alana; Kassen, Rees] Univ Ottawa, Ctr Adv Res Environm Genom, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Bailey, Susan F.] Aarhus Univ, Bioinformat Res Ctr, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark\",\"Schick, A (reprint author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.\",alana.schick@gmail.com,\"Bailey, Susan/B-4440-2013\",\"Bailey, Susan/0000-0002-2294-1229\",,,,36.0,11.0,11.0,0.0,18.0,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,\"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA\",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

This article gives an overview on these activities and links them to other relevant research. Results from the NCA springs and comparable sites revealed that spring water harbors abundant natural microbial communities even in aquifers with high water residence times and the absence of immediate surface influence. Apparently, hydrogeology has a strong impact on the concentration and size of the observed microbes, and total cell counts (TCC) were suggested as a useful means for spring type classification. Measurement of microbial activities at the NCA springs revealed extremely low microbial growth rates in the base flow component of the studied spring waters and indicated the importance of biofilm-associated microbial activities in sediments and on rock surfaces. Based on genetic analysis, the autochthonous microbial endokarst community (AMEC) versus transient microbial endokarst community (TMEC) concept was proposed for the NCA springs, and further details within this overview article are given to prompt its future evaluation. In this regard, it is well known that during high-discharge situations, surface-associated microbes and nutrients such as from soil habitats or human settlementspotentially containing fecal-associated pathogens as the most critical water-quality hazardmay be rapidly flushed into vulnerable karst aquifers. In this context, a framework for the comprehensive analysis of microbial pollution has been proposed for the NCA springs to support the sustainable management of drinking water safety in accordance with recent World Health Organization guidelines. Near-real-time online water quality monitoring, microbial source tracking (MST) and MST-guided quantitative microbial-risk assessment (QMRA) are examples of the proposed analytical tools.

We report data on retention in care and its associated determinants in Tigray, Ethiopia. Methods We used data from the CASA project, a prospective observational and multi-site study of a cohort of HIV-infected patients who initiated ART for the first time in Tigray. Four participating health facilities (HFs) located in the South of Tigray were considered for this study. Patients were followed for one year after ART initiation. The main outcome measure was represented by the current retention in care, defined as the proportion of patients who were alive and receiving ART at the same HF one year after ART initiation. Patients who started ART between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013 were included in this analysis. Patients were followed for one year after ART initiation. The determinants of retention were analysed using univariate and multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards model with robust sandwich estimates to account for within HF correlation. Results The four participating HFs in Tigray were able to retain overall 85.1% of their patients after one year from starting ART. Loss to follow-up (5.5%) and transfers to other HF (6.6) were the main determinant of attrition. A multivariate analysis shows that the factors significantly associated with retention were the type of HF, gender and active TB. Alamata health center was the HF with the highest attrition rate (HR 2.99, 95% CI: 2.77-3.23). Active TB (HR 1.72, 95% CI: 1.23-2.41) and gender (HR 1.64, 95% CI: 1.10-2.56) were also significantly associated with attrition. Conclusions Although Ethiopia has significantly improved access to the ART program, achieving and maintaining a satisfactory long-term retention rate is a future goal. This is difficult because of different retention rates among HFs. Moreover specific interventions should be directed to people of different sex to improve retention in care in male population.\",\"[Bucciardini, Raffaella; Fragola, Vincenzo; Lucattini, Stefano; Pugliese, Katherina; Binelli, Andrea; De Castro, Paola; Terlizzi, Roberta; Fucili, Luca; Di Gregorio, Massimiliano; Mirra, Marco; Olivieri, Erika; Vella, Stefano] Ist Super Sanita, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Abegaz, Teshome; Tadesse, Eskedar; Berhe, Micheal; Haile, Amanuel; Abraham, Loko] Mekelle Univ, Coll Hlth Sci, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Halifom, Atakilt; Teklu, Tsigemariam; Zegeye, Teame; CASA-project Health Facilities] Tigray Reg Hlth Bur, Mekelle, Ethiopia\",\"Bucciardini, R (reprint author), Ist Super Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, I-00161 Rome, Italy.\",raffaella.bucciardini@iss.it,,,\"Italian Ministry of Health-Department of Prevention and Innovation, Rome, Italy\",\"This work was supported by the Italian Ministry of Health-Department of Prevention and Innovation, Rome, Italy.

Methods: The conceptual framework was developed in interaction with stakeholders representing relevant authorities and organisations responsible for managing environmental quality of water bodies. Stakeholder needs were compiled via a survey and dialogue. The content of the conceptual framework was thereafter developed with inputs from relevant scientific disciplines. Results: The conceptual framework consists of four access points: Chemicals, Environment, Abatement and Society, representing different aspects and approaches to engaging in the issue of chemical contamination of surface waters. It widens the scope for assessment and management of chemicals in comparison to a traditional (mostly) perchemical risk assessment approaches by including abatement-and societal approaches as optional solutions. The solution-focused approach implies an identification of abatement-and policy options upfront in the risk assessment process. The conceptual framework was designed for use in current and future chemical pollution assessments for the aquatic environment, including the specific challenges encountered in prioritising individual chemicals and mixtures, and is applicable for the development of approaches for safe chemical management in a broader sense. The four access points of the conceptual framework are interlinked by four key topics representing the main scientific challenges that need to be addressed, i.e.: identifying and prioritising hazardous chemicals at different scales; selecting relevant and efficient abatement options; providing regulatory support for chemicals management; predicting and prioritising future chemical risks. The conceptual framework aligns current challenges in the safe production and use of chemicals. The current state of knowledge and implementation of these challenges is described. Conclusions: The use of the conceptual framework, and addressing the challenges, is intended to support: (1) forwarding sustainable use of chemicals, (2) identification of pollutants of priority concern for cost-effective management, (3) the selection of optimal abatement options and (4) the development and use of optimised legal and policy instruments.\",\"[Munthe, John; Brorstrom-Lunden, Eva; Rahmberg, Magnus; Rydberg, Tomas] IVL Swedish Environm Res Inst, POB 53021, S-40014 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Posthuma, Leo] RIVM Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, POB 1, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Altenburger, Rolf; Brack, Werner; Herraez, David Lopez] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res GmbH, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Altenburger, Rolf; Brack, Werner] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Environm Res Biol 5, Aachen, Germany; [Bunke, Dirk] OEKO Inst Appl Ecol, Postfach 17 71, D-79017 Freiburg, Germany; [Engelen, Guy] VITO Flemish Inst Technol Res, Boeretang 200, B-2400 Mol, Belgium; [Gawlik, Bernd Manfred] DG Joint Res Ctr, Unit H 01, Water Resources Unit, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [van Gils, Jos] Deltares, Postbus 177, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands; [Slobodnik, Jaroslav] EI Environm Inst, Kos, Slovakia; [van Wezel, Annemarie] KWR Watercycle Res Inst, Nieuwegein, Netherlands; [Posthuma, Leo] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Environm Sci, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van Wezel, Annemarie] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst, Utrecht, Netherlands\",\"Munthe, J (reprint author), IVL Swedish Environm Res Inst, POB 53021, S-40014 Gothenburg, Sweden.\",john.munthe@ivl.se,,\"van Wezel, Annemarie/0000-0002-6875-957X\",\"European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [603437]; Foundation of the Swedish Environmental Research Institute (SIVL)\",\"The SOLUTIONS project has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under Grant Agreement No. 603437.; Additional funding for IVL was obtained from the Foundation of the Swedish Environmental Research Institute (SIVL).\",,71.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,\"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY\",2190-4715,,,ENVIRON SCI EUR,Environ.

Typically, in LCA methods, when a sustainable forestry management is assumed, biogenic carbon is not included in the calculation since forest products are considered as carbon neutral due to the full regeneration of biomass in forest at the end of a rotation period. The purpose of this article is to investigate the effect of storing carbon in biogenic materials and lime-based products when they are used as construction materials and left long in a building. Five different alternative exterior walls with different construction technologies are compared. In the first two alternatives (STR and HEM), a significant amount of fast-growing biogenic material is used as thermal insulation, while the third (TIM) represents a typical timber frame structure with mineral insulation. The last two are traditional wall alternatives based on bricks (BRI) and cast concrete (CON) with an additional external thermal insulation composite system (ETICS) in EPS. A model based on a dynamic LCA is adopted to include timing in the calculation. The results, expressed in terms of radiative forcing in the atmosphere, show that storing carbon in fast-growing biogenic materials is much more efficient than in timber elements. The carbon stored in fast-growing biogenic materials is fully captured by crop regrowth only one year after construction, while a longer time is expected for forest products due to the long rotation period required for forest regrowth.\",\"[Pittau, Francesco; Krause, Felix; Lumia, Gabriele; Habert, Guillaume] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Sustainable Construct, Inst Bau & Infrastrukturmanagement, Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Lumia, Gabriele] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, Via G Ponzio 31, I-20133 Milan, Italy\",\"Pittau, F (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Sustainable Construct, Inst Bau & Infrastrukturmanagement, Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.\",pittau@ibi.baug.ethz.ch,,,,,,58.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,10.0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,\"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND\",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

The theory of planned behavior model was applied to examine the effect that community-based health examinations had on people's health concepts regarding seeking future health examinations. The research participants were individuals who had received a health examination provided at two branches of a hospital in central Taiwan in 2012. The hospital's two branches held a total of 14 free community-based health examination sessions. The hospital provided health examination equipment and staff to perform health examinations during public holidays. We conducted an exploratory questionnaire survey to collect data and implemented cross-sectional research based on anonymous self-ratings to examine the public's intention to receive future community-based or hospital-based health examinations. Including of 807 valid questionnaires, accounting for 89.4% of the total number of questionnaires distributed. The correlation coefficients of the second-order structural model indicate that attitudes positively predict behavioral intentions (gamma = .66, p < .05), and subjective norms also positively predict behavioral intentions (gamma = .66, p < .01). By contrast, perceived behavioral control has no significant relationship with behavioral intentions (gamma = -.71, p > .05). The results of the first-order structural model indicated that the second-order constructs had a high explanatory power for the first-order constructs. People's health concepts regarding health examinations and their desire to continue receiving health examinations must be considered when promoting health examinations in the community. Regarding hospital management and the government's implementation of primary health care, health examination services should address people's medical needs to increase coverage and participation rates and reduce the waste of medical resources.\",\"[Tu, Shih-Kai] Taichung Armed Forces Gen Hosp, Dept Family Phys, Taichung, Taiwan; [Tu, Shih-Kai; Liao, Hung-En] Asia Univ, Dept Healthcare Adm, Taichung, Taiwan\",\"Liao, HE (reprint author), Asia Univ, Dept Healthcare Adm, Taichung, Taiwan.\",heliao@asia.edu.tw,,,,,,41.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,\"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD\",ABINGDON,\"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND\",1354-8506,1465-3966,,PSYCHOL HEALTH MED,Psychol.

The results indicate that long-term total carbon storage ranges from 101 to 156 Mg Cha(-1), with the largest carbon stock in the living biomass of long rotation sal forests (82 Mg Cha(-1)). The net annual carbon sequestration rates were achieved for fast growing short rotation poplar (8 Mg Cha(-1)yr(-1)) and Eucalyptus (6 Mg Cha(-1)yr(-1)) plantations followed by moderate growing teak forests (2 Mg Cha(-1)yr(-1)) and slow growing long rotation sal forests (1 Mg Cha(-1)yr(-1)). Due to fast growth rate and adaptability to a range of environments, short rotation plantations, in addition to carbon storage rapidly produce biomass for energy and contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. We also used the model to evaluate the effect of changing rotation length and thinning regime on carbon stocks of forest ecosystem (trees+soil) and wood products, respectively for sal and teak forests. The carbon stock in soil and products was less sensitive than carbon stock of trees to the change in rotation length. Extending rotation length from the recommended 120 to 150 years increased the average carbon stock of forest ecosystem (trees+soil) by 12%. The net primary productivity was highest (3.7 Mg ha(-1)yr(-1)) when a 60-year rotation length was applied but decreased with increasing rotation length (e.g., 1.7 Mg ha(-1)yr(-1)) at 150 years. Goal of maximum carbon storage and production of more valuable saw logs can be achieved from longer rotation lengths. 'No thinning' has the largest biomass, but from an economical perspective, there will be no wood available from thinning operations to replace fossil fuel for bioenergy and to the pulp industry and such patches have high risks of forest fires, insects etc. Extended rotation lengths and reduced thinning intensity could enhance the long-term capacity of forest ecosystems to sequester carbon. While accounting for effects of climate change, a combination of bioenergy and carbon sequestration will be best to mitigation of CO(2) emission in the long term.\",\"[Kaul, Meenakshi; Mohren, G. M.

This protein deficit in livestock production presents a risk to social, economic and environmental progress in Europe. In this study the impact of incorporating novel ingredients into future chicken diet formulations to serve as European sourced alternatives to imported soybeans was investigated. The novel ingredients considered were: microalgae, macroalgae, duckweed, yeast protein concentrate, bacterial protein meal, leaf protein concentrate and insects. Using horizon scanning and a modelling approach, the nutritional requirements of two potential meat-producing chicken lines were simulated. The two chicken lines were a fast-growing line based on the apparent maximum feed efficiency that could be achieved through further artificial selection, and a reduced growth rate for high welfare line. Diets were formulated to include the novel ingredients, whilst meeting the nutritional requirements of the birds. The effects of diet composition on indicators of environmental burdens, associated with feed production for the poultry industry, were then assessed. We found that soybean products can be completely replaced by novel feed ingredients, whilst reducing the greenhouse gas emissions and arable land requirements for feed provision relative to conventional diets formulated for both chicken lines. Switching from conventional diets to diets which incorporate novel ingredients was also shown to mitigate the increased environmental burdens associated with moving towards higher welfare livestock systems. Incorporation of novel ingredients in diet formulations offers a viable option for providing sustainable and nutritionally balanced livestock feed in the future and thus provides huge potential for facilitating bespoke feeding strategies and specific management choices for mitigating environmental impacts of chicken systems.

Methods The Boston Area Community Health cohort is a multi-stage 1:1:1 stratified random sample of self-identified African-American, Hispanic and white adults from three Boston inner city areas. We measured 62 ancestry informative markers, fasting glucose (FG), HbA(1c), BMI and SES (income, education, occupation and insurance status) and analysed 1,387 eligible individuals (379 African-American, 411 Hispanic, 597 white) without clinical or biochemical evidence of diabetes. We used three-heritage multinomial linear regression models to test the association of FG or HbA(1c) with genetic ancestry proportion adjusted for: (1) age and sex; (2) age, sex and BMI; and (3) age, sex, BMI and SES. Results Mean age- and sex-adjusted FG levels were 5.73 and 5.54 mmol/l among those with 100% African or European ancestry, respectively. Using per cent European ancestry as the referent, each 1% increase in African ancestry proportion was associated with an age- and sex-adjusted FG increase of 0.0019 mmol/l (p = 0.01). In the BMI- and SES-adjusted model the slope was 0.0019 (p = 0.02). Analysis of HbA(1c) gave similar results. Conclusions/interpretation A greater proportion of African genetic ancestry is independently associated with higher FG levels in a non-diabetic community-based cohort, even accounting for other ancestry proportions, obesity and SES. The results suggest that differences between African-Americans and whites in type 2 diabetes risk may include genetically mediated differences in glucose homeostasis.\",\"[Meigs, James B.; Porneala, Bianca] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Grant, Richard W.] Kaiser Permanente No Calif, Div Res, Oakland, CA USA; [Piccolo, Rebecca; Marceau, Lisa; McKinlay, John B.] New England Res Inst, Watertown, MA 02172 USA; [Lopez, Lenny] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Dispar Solut Ctr,Mongan Inst Hlth Policy, Boston, MA USA; [Florez, Jose C.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Human Genet Res & Diabet Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Florez, Jose C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA USA; [Florez, Jose C.] Broad Inst, Program Med & Populat Genet, Boston, MA USA\",\"Meigs, JB (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med, 50 Staniford St,9th Floor, Boston, MA 02114 USA.\",jmeigs@partners.org,,\"Grant, Richard/0000-0002-6164-8025\",\"NIDDK [R01 DK080786, K24 DK080140, R01 DK078616]\",\"This study was supported by NIDDK R01 DK080786 'Upstream contributors to downstream disparities in type 2 diabetes', as well as by NIDDK K24 DK080140 and R01 DK078616 (JBM).\",,43.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,9.0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,\"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA\",0012-186X,1432-0428,,DIABETOLOGIA,Diabetologia,SEP,2014.0,57,9,,,,,1850,1858,,10.1007/s00125-014-3301-1,,,,9.0,Endocrinology & Metabolism,Endocrinology & Metabolism,AM7MG,WOS:000340050800015,24942103.0,green_accepted,,,2018-07-03\n",

LUCC modeling is an important approach to understanding what has happened in the landscape and what may change in the future. Moreover, prospective modeling can provide sustainable and efficient decision support for land planning and environmental management. This paper modeled the LUCCs between 1996, 2001 and 2006 in the LISW in the New England region, which experienced an increase in developed area and a decrease of forest. The low-density development pattern played an important role in the loss of forest and the expansion of urban areas. The key driving forces were distance to developed areas, distance to roads, and social-economic drivers, such as nighttime light intensity and population density. In addition, this paper compared and evaluated two integrated LUCC models-the logistic regression-Markov chain model and the multi-layer perception-Markov chain (MLP-MC) model. Both models achieved high accuracy in prediction, but the MLP-MC model performed slightly better. Finally, a land use map for 2026 was predicted by using the MLP-MC model, and it indicates the continued loss of forest and increase of developed area.\",\"[Zhai, Ruiting; Zhang, Chuanrong; Li, Weidong; Boyer, Mark A.; Hanink, Dean] Univ Connecticut, Dept Geog, 215 Glenbrook Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Zhang, Chuanrong; Li, Weidong; Boyer, Mark A.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, 3107 Horsebarn Hill Rd,U-4210, Storrs, CT 06269 USA\",\"Zhang, CR (reprint author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Geog, 215 Glenbrook Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.; Zhang, CR (reprint author), Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, 3107 Horsebarn Hill Rd,U-4210, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.\",ruiting.zhai@uconn.edu; chuanrong.zhang@uconn.edu; weidong.li@uconn.edu; mark.boyer@uconn.edu; dean.hanink@uconn.edu,,\"Li, Weidong/0000-0002-4558-3292\",USA NSF [1414108],This research is partially supported by USA NSF grant No. 1414108.

For that purpose back-propagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms were used to induce predictive models on a dataset of the Zwalm river basin (Flanders, Belgium). This dataset consisted of 120 samples, collected over a 2-year period. Fifteen environmental variables were measured at each site, as well as the abundance of the aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa. Different neural networks were developed and optimized to obtain the best model configuration for the prediction of the habitat suitability of macroinvertebrate taxa. The best performing number of hidden layers and neurons and training algorithms have been searched for. The different options were theoretically and practically validated and assessed. The theoretical validation was based on cross-validation. For the practical validation, potential applications of the neural network models were analyzed, and the predictive performance of the models was assessed using ecological expert knowledge. The results indicate that the number of times a taxon was found in the whole river basin influences the performance measures and the architecture of the network. Based on the Cohen's kappa, it could be concluded that ANN models predicting the presence/absence of very rare taxa (e.g. Aplexa) or very common taxa (e.g. Tubificidae) were rather irrelevant, although their correctly classified instances (CCI) was high. Predicting the presence/absence of Asellidae (a moderately present taxon), the highest performances (CCI and Cohen's kappa) were found for the network model with two hidden layers each having 10 neurons. When calculation time was also taken into account, the network model with one hidden layer having 10 neurons could be preferred. Applying this network architecture, performances were only slightly worse, while calculation time was a lot shorter. One may also conclude that not all network models resulted in a relevant relation between a variable and a specific taxon. For Gammaridae for example. a rather small ANN structure gave a better idea of the impact of dissolved oxygen on its presence than a larger one. More reliable predictions and ecological interpretations for river ecosystem management would thus be possible provided the best configuration could be found. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This transition in production patterns should develop sustainably without negative effects to the environment and society. Therefore, appropriate assessment tools are required to measure and document (un)sustainable aspects. The use of life cycle thinking enables the assessment of sustainability issues relating to such wood-based products. However, life cycle assessment approaches assessing sustainability implications from a regional perspective have not been fully developed yet. A regional perspective is especially required when assessing products' social implications as they are determined by the national and regional socio-economic conditions. In a previous work, we established the \"\"RESPONSA\"\" framework (i.e. a REgional SPecific cONtextualised Social life cycle Assessment) to assess a product's social performance from a regional perspective, directly accounting to the organisations behaviour and therefore providing specific information to support producers' decision-making. This paper focuses on developing a set of social indices and related indicators applicable to wood-based production systems in Germany. This was done in four steps: 1) screening of global, German and wood related sustainability standards; 2) analysis of sLCA case studies; 3) conducting of stakeholder interviews. This allowed the preselection of social aspects relevant to the socio-economic context of interest (i.e. wood-based production chains in German bioeconomy regions).

Specialists with competencies in various aspects of this problem are needed: to develop high-tech products for rehabilitation purposes, to design, produce and use them. To solve this problem, the authors propose an \"\"umbrella model\"\" for training master students. The essence of the model is the creation of the same profile within the three fields of master's training that would cover the entire life cycle of high-tech devices for the rehabilitation of persons with SN - from design and production to operation. To implement this model, three fields of master's training were selected: Mechatronics and Robotics, Biotechnical Systems and Technologies and Physical Culture. Programs for the profile with the common name \"\"Engineering of Rehabilitation and Auxiliary Technologies\"\" were developed in the three fields. A curriculum was developed that provided basic and elective parts. Disciplines of the two modules of the basic part, as well as disciplines of the interdisciplinary professional module of the elective part of the curriculum, correspond to the fields of training; master students of each field study them in the general flow with students of other profiles of this direction. Disciplines of the elective interdisciplinary professional module \"\"Engineering Rehabilitation and Auxiliary Technologies\"\" are common for master students of all fields who study in this profile, and are studied jointly. The structure of this module was developed taking into account the need to develop competencies that will allow program graduates to effectively interact in the development, production and operation of hightech devices for the rehabilitation of persons with SN. The second important distinctive feature of the \"\"umbrella\"\" format of the master's training is the joint project activities of students of the three fields during internships and research work in the semester. To form competencies related to the interaction of specialists from different fields with each other, at the first stages of training the creation of project teams is planned. Teams will include master students from different fields of the program to solve complex problems related to the creation of innovative products for the implementation of rehabilitation and support technologies for persons with SN. Students will jointly have to suggest an idea for such a project, justify its effectiveness for rehabilitation and develop a technology for its implementation. The implementation of the described format for training masters in the field of engineering of rehabilitation and auxiliary technologies has broad prospects. This sphere (production of goods and services to meet the needs of persons with SN) is one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy in Russia and in the world today; it receives support from international non-governmental foundations. The need for specialists of this profile is constantly growing. At the same time, the proposed format for the implementation of training in the master's program is unique; accessible sources contain information about the implementation of similar programs in other universities.\",\"[Kapilevich, Leonid V.] Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia; [Kapilevich, Leonid V.; Guzyr, Vladimir V.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Tomsk, Russia\",\"Kapilevich, LV (reprint author), Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia.; Kapilevich, LV (reprint author), Tomsk Polytech Univ, Tomsk, Russia.\",kapil@yandex.ru; guzyr@tpu.ru,\"Kapilevich, Leonid/N-9196-2014\",,,,,11.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,TOMSK STATE UNIV,TOMSK,\"LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA\",1561-7793,1561-803X,,TOMSK STATE UNIV J,Tomsk State Univ.

Despite poorer health, significant inequity characterises the funding of PHC services in Australia's most remote areas. This pilot study sought to ascertain what funding is required to ensure equitable access to sustainable, high quality primary health care irrespective of geographical remoteness of communities. Methods: High performing remote Primary Health Care (PHC) services were selected using improvement measures from the Australian Primary Care Collaboratives Program and validated by health experts. Eleven PHC services provided data relating to the types of services provided, level of service utilisation, human resources, operating and capital expenses. A further four services that provide visiting PHC to remote communities provided information on the level and cost of these services. Demographic data for service catchment areas (including estimated resident population, age, Indigenous status, English spoken at home and workforce participation) were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2011 census. Formal statistical inference (p-values) were derived in the linear regression via the nonparametric bootstrap. Results: A direct linear relationship was observed between the total cost of resident PHC services and population, while cost per capita decreased with increasing population. Services in smaller communities had a higher number of nursing staff per 1000 residents and provided more consultations per capita than those in larger communities. The number of days of visiting services received by a community each year also increased with population. A linear regression with bootstrapped statistical inference predicted a significant regression equation where the cost of resident services per annum is equal to $ 1,251,893.92 + ($ 1698.83 x population) and the cost of resident and visiting services is equal to $ 1,378,870.85 + ($ 2600.00 x population). Conclusions: The research findings provide empirical evidence based on real costs to guide funding for remote PHC services that takes into account the safety and equity requirements for a minimum viable service. This method can be used as a transparent, coordinated approach to ensure the equitable delivery of sustainable, high quality PHC in remote communities. This will in turn contribute to improved health outcomes.\",\"[Wakerman, John; Sparrow, Lisa; Thomas, Susan L.] Flinders Northern Terr, Casuarina, Australia; [Humphreys, John S.] Monash Univ, Sch Rural Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jones, Mike] Macquarie Univ, Psychol Dept, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wakerman, John; Sparrow, Lisa; Thomas, Susan L.; Humphreys, John S.; Jones, Mike] Flinders Univ S Australia, Ctr Res Excellence Rural & Remote Primary Hlth Ca, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia\",\"Sparrow, L (reprint author), Flinders Northern Terr, Casuarina, Australia.; Sparrow, L (reprint author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Ctr Res Excellence Rural & Remote Primary Hlth Ca, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia.\",lisa.sparrow@flinders.edu.au,,\"Wakerman, John/0000-0002-8546-5434; Jones, Michael/0000-0003-0565-4938\",Commonwealth of Australia,\"The research reported in this paper is a project of the Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute, which is supported by a grant from the Commonwealth of Australia as represented by the Department of Health.

Trying to address these issues, transportation policy makers face major challenges in their attempts to identify sustainable transportation alternatives. To provide a systematic approach for such endeavors, this paper evaluates different public bus technologies as urban transportation alternatives. In order to incorporate expert opinion into the model environment, a set of sustainability related criteria is established and expert opinion regarding the sustainability of vehicle options are obtained based on each criterion. Since the fulfillment of a single criterion is not sufficient to deduct meaningful conclusions, the evaluation considered the dependencies among the decision criteria in search of compromising solutions. To address this, an aggregation method based on Intuitionistic Fuzzy Choquet Integral (IFCI) and Group Decision Making (GDM) techniques is proposed. A fuzzy pairwise-comparison measure identification method is used in IFCI in order to define its parameters. TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), another multi criteria method that ignores interactions, and 2-additive Choquet integral are also employed. The outcomes of IFCI, 2-additive Choquet integral and TOPSIS are compared with one another. The findings indicate that dependencies among decision criteria significantly affect the selection process of the most sustainable urban transportation system and can alter the rankings.\",\"[Buyukozkan, Gulcin; Feyzioglu, Orhan; Gocer, Fethullah] Galatasaray Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-34349 Istanbul, Turkey\",\"Buyukozkan, G (reprint author), Galatasaray Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-34349 Istanbul, Turkey.\",gulcin.buyukozkan@gmail.com; orhanfeyzioglu@gmail.com; gocer.fethullah@gmail.com.tr,,,\"Galatasaray University Research Fund [17.402.004, 17.402.009]\",The authors kindly extend thanks to the industry experts for their valuable contributions.

Prior research has supported a six-item short form of the Whiteley Index (WI), a commonly used measure of health anxiety, among English-speaking respondents. This study examined the measurement invariance of the WI-6 among Black (n = 183), Latino (n = 173), and White (n = 177) respondents seeking treatment at a U.S. community health center. Results supported a bifactor model of the WI-6 among the composite sample (N = 533), suggesting the presence of a general factor and two domain-specific factors. Results supported the incremental validity of one of the domain-specific factors in accounting for unique variance in somatic symptom severity scores beyond the general factor. Multiple-groups confirmatory factor analysis supported the configural, metric, ands scalar invariance of the bifactor WI-6 model across the three groups of respondents. Results provide support for the measurement invariance of the WI-6 among Black, Latino, and White respondents. The potential use of the WI-6 in primary care, and broader, settings is discussed.\",\"[Fergus, Thomas A.] Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Kelley, Lance P.; Griggs, Jackson O.] Waco Family Med Residency Program, Waco, TX USA\",\"Fergus, TA (reprint author), Baylor Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, One Bear Pl 97334, Waco, TX 76798 USA.\",Thomas_Fergus@baylor.edu,,,,,,50.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,\"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA\",1073-1911,1552-3489,,ASSESSMENT,Assessment,MAR,2018.0,25,2,,,,,247,258,,10.1177/1073191116645908,,,,12.0,\"Psychology, Clinical\",Psychology,FV5RI,WOS:000424639600009,27121080.0,,,,2018-07-03\n",

In order to be an effective carbon dioxide mitigation strategy, engineered mineral carbonation processes have to result in a net reduction of CO2 emissions. This is particularly the case for feedstock such as platinum group metal (PGM) tailings, which are comprised largely of the relatively inert pyroxene mineral. This study evaluated the viability of using these tailings for carbon sequestration through mineral carbonation on the basis of an assessment of the potential carbon footprint of selected engineered processes. The processes selected include the ammonium salts process, the direct aqueous process, the Abo Akademi University (AAU) multi-stage gas-solid route, a mineral acid pH swing process and Lackner's multi-stage HC1 extraction process. Aspen Plus v8 software was used for mass and energy balance modelling, whilst the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) software programme SimaPro v7.7.3 was used for carbon emissions accounting. The selected processes all resulted in higher emissions of carbon dioxide than those sequestered. This was particularly the case for Lackner's multi stage HCl process (18 295 kg-CO(2)e) and the indirect aqueous ammonium salts (8 798 kg-CO(2)e) processes. The process having the lowest carbon footprint was the AAU process (1 354 kg-CO(2)e), followed by the direct aqueous process (2 364 kg-CO(2)e) and the mineral acid pH swing (3 126 kg-CO(2)e). The unit processes making the most significant contribution to the carbon footprint of the mineral carbonation process systems are heat requirements and chemical reagent make-up. Sensitivity analysis shows that the direct aqueous and AAU process emissions can be reduced beyond the CO2 emissions threshold when conversion is increased.\",\"[Ncongwane, M. S.; Broadhurst, J.

A key process is cell division. We have, however, been unable to estimate division rate in natural populations at the appropriate timescale (hours to days) for extended periods of time (months to years). For phytoplankton, the diel change in cell size distribution is related to division rate, which offers an avenue to obtain estimates from in situ observations. We show that a matrix population model, fit to hourly cell size distributions, accurately estimates division rates of both cultured and natural populations of Synechococcus. Application of the model to Synechococcus at the Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory provides an unprecedented view that reveals a distinct seasonality in division rates. This information allows us to separate the effects of growth and loss quantitatively over an entire seasonal cycle. We find that division and loss processes are tightly coupled throughout the year. The large seasonal changes in cell abundance are the result of periods of time (weeks to months) when there are small systematic differences that favor either net growth or loss. We also find that temperature plays a critical role in limiting division rate during the annual spring bloom. This approach opens a path to quantify the role of Synechococcus in ecological and biogeochemical processes in natural systems.\",\"[Hunter-Cevera, Kristen R.; Neubert, Michael G.; Olson, Robert J.; Shalapyonok, Alexi; Sosik, Heidi M.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Solow, Andrew R.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Marine Policy Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA\",\"Sosik, HM (reprint author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\",hsosik@whoi.edu,,\"Sosik, Heidi/0000-0002-4591-2842; Neubert, Michael/0000-0001-8820-5008\",\"US National Science Foundation [OCE-0530830, OCE-1031256, DEB-1257545]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNX11AF07G]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [934]; National Defense Science and Engineering graduate fellowship from the US Department of Defense\",\"We thank A.

Pyrogenic humic acid has been included in our study since it will be released to the environment in the case of large-scale application of biochar, potentially creating Darks Earths or Terra Preta soils. A surface complexation approach has been developed that aims to describe the competitive behavior of natural organic matter (NOM) in soil as well as model systems. Modeling points unexpectedly to a strong change of the molecular conformation of humic acid (HA) with a predominant adsorption in the Stern layer domain at low NOM loading. In soil, mineral oxide surfaces remain efficiently loaded by mineral-protected organic carbon (OC), equivalent with a layer thickness of >=similar to 0.5 nm that represents at least 0.1-1.0% OC, while surface-associated OC may be even three times higher. In natural systems, surface complexation modeling should account for this pervasive NOM coverage. With our charge distribution model for NOM (NOM-CD), the pH-dependent oxyanion competition of the organo-mineral oxide fraction can be described. For pyrogenic HA, a more than 10-fold increase in dissolved phosphate is predicted at long-term applications of biochar or black carbon.\",\"[Hiemstra, Tjisse; Mia, Shamim; Duhaut, Pierre-Benoit; Molleman, Bastiaan] Wageningen Univ, Dept Soil Qual, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands\",\"Hiemstra, T (reprint author), Wageningen Univ, Dept Soil Qual, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.\",tjisse.hiemstra@wur.nl,,\"Mia, Shamim/0000-0002-5013-8759\",\"International Research and Education Fund (INREF) of Wageningen University, The Netherlands\",\"Liping Weng is gratefully acknowledged for providing us the goethite material.

More accessible LCA tools customised for agriculture are emerging, but their effectiveness has not been considered. The aim of the work was to understand how tool features influence effectiveness and to propose criteria for effectiveness, for informing the design and evaluation of tools. We define 'customised' tools as those that focus on the life cycle phases and aspects of most relevance for the particular sector (in this case agriculture), and that parameterise practice variables to enable evaluation of practice alternatives. A theoretical framework for the role of tools in agricultural practice change was first used to define the desired objectives of LCA tools: i) to engage agricultural agents of change by catering to their needs, being accessible and being easy to use, ii) to generate information that users can interpret for informing environmental improvements, and iii) to generate information that can align with the wider decision making context. A desktop review of 14 LCA customised agriculture tools identified the features that influence these objectives: tool purpose, mode of access, ease of use, results presentation, degree of practice parameterisation, capacity for regionalised analysis, system scope, impact categories assessed, and alignment with other assessment frameworks. From this, a set of effectiveness criteria for customised LCA tools was developed. A few criteria from amongst this set will be challenges for future tool development: the balance between analysis capacity and ease of use, enabling regionalised analysis, and the presentation of results in a way that aids interpretation for informing environmental improvements.

The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functions quantified in prior experiments suggests that initial losses of biodiversity have relatively small impacts on properties like community biomass production; however, beyond some threshold, increasing losses lead to accelerating declines in function. Some have questioned whether a saturating relationship between diversity and community biomass production is an artifact of overly simplified experiments that manipulate diversity in homogeneous conditions over short time-scales in which niche differences may not be realized. Others have questioned whether even the modest effects of biodiversity observed in experiments would be discernible in natural systems where they could be over-ridden by the stronger influence of abiotic factors. Here, we used a biogeographic dataset to assess how the taxonomic richness of aquatic primary producers relates to community biomass in unmanipulated lake ecosystems in the US, and then compared these findings to prior experiments. We used structural equation modeling to evaluate hypotheses about the effects of algal richness on community biomass while accounting for covariance with environmental parameters measured in the USEPA's National Lakes Assessment (NLA), which sampled 1157 freshwater lakes. These analyses converged on a single best-fit model ((2)= 0.31, p = 0.58) wherein community algal biomass was a function of three explanatory variables - nitrogen, phosphorus, and algal richness. The quantitative magnitude of the algal diversity (x) - biomass (y) relationship in the NLA dataset is statistically greater than that documented in the average biodiversity experiment. It did, however, lie at approximately the 75th percentile of experimental relationships, indicating the diversity-biomass relationship in unmanipulated lakes is within the range that has been characterized experimentally.\",\"[Zimmerman, Emily K.; Cardinale, Bradley J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Cardinale, Bradley J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA\",\"Zimmerman, EK (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.\",ezim@umich.edu,,,,,,56.0,13.0,14.0,4.0,53.0,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,\"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA\",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2014.0,123,3,,,,,267,278,,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00777.x,,,,12.0,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AB2ZJ,WOS:000331660800002,,,,,2018-07-03\n",

Animal welfare is assessed during farm life and during slaughter. The indicators differ in how they value premature death. All three consider (1) the life quality of an animal such as space allowance, (2) the slaughter age either as life duration or life fraction, and (3) the number of animals affected for providing a product unit, e.g. 1 Mcal. One of the indicators additionally takes into account a moral value denoting their intelligence and self-awareness. The framework allows for comparisons across studies and products and for applications at large spatial scales. To illustrate the framework, eight products were analysed and compared: beef, pork, poultry, milk, eggs, salmon, shrimps, and, as a novel protein source, insects. Insects are granted to live longer fractions of their normal life spans, and their life quality is less compromised due to a lower assumed sentience. Still, they perform worst according to all three indicators, as their small body sizes only yield low product quantities. Therefore, we discourage from eating insects. In contrast, milk is the product that reduces animal welfare the least according to two of the three indicators and it performs relatively better than other animal products in most categories. The difference in animal welfare is mostly larger for different animal products than for different production systems of the same product. This implies that, besides less consumption of animal-based products, a shift to other animal products can significantly improve animal welfare. While the animal welfare assessment is simplified, it allows for a direct integration into life cycle sustainability assessment. There is a trade-off between applicability and indicator complexity, but even a simple estimate of animal welfare is much better than ignoring the issue, as is the common practice in life cycle sustainability assessments. Future research should be directed towards elaborating the life quality criterion and extending the product coverage.\",\"[Scherer, Laura] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci CML, Einsteinweg 2, NL-2333 CC Leiden, Netherlands; [Tomasik, Brian] Fdn Res Inst, Berlin, Germany; [Rueda, Oscar] Effect Altruism Fdn, Basel, Switzerland; [Pfister, Stephan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn, Zurich, Switzerland\",\"Scherer, L (reprint author), Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci CML, Einsteinweg 2, NL-2333 CC Leiden, Netherlands.\",l.a.scherer@cml.leidenuniv.nl,,\"Scherer, Laura/0000-0002-0194-9942\",,,,122.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,6.0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,\"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY\",0948-3349,1614-7502,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

In accordance with the sustainability approach, every potential cost and energy cutting as well as social sustainability measure for wastewater treatment should be explored. Nonetheless, Lithuania wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in the sustainability context have never been evaluated before. A comprehensive set of 30 sustainable development indicators (SDI) (9 functional, 11 environmental, 5 economical and 6 socio-cultural) in connection with functional unit were applied to medium-sized Jurbarkas WWTP (with a capacity of 2,540 m(3)/d). Sustainability evaluation involved life cycle of WWTP maintenance phase as well as water inlet, outlet and manufacturing. Results revealed that in the general context of sustainability the stability of plant varied greatly. Nine SDI haven't reached the sustainability approach. Graphically plotted results in the four sustainability categories have shown that relatively highest environmental impact regarding the maximum covered plot is caused due to an economical unsustainability. Operational and maintenance costs per volume of wastewater treated were approximately 2.23 higher than the cost to consumers per one cubic meter of wastewater treated, therefore depreciation, repairs, material costs and wastewater treatment costs accounted to 87%.

But few have been designed specially for oases in arid desert areas where the ecology and the environment are vulnerable because of unwise water-land resources utilization. In order to analyze the moisture transformation in the Hotan Oasis in the Taklimakan Desert in China, and hence to provide scientific references for the rational exploitation and allocation of the limited water-land resources, for the purpose of ensuring that the vulnerable ecology and environment there can be gradually improved and the social economy there can develop sustainably, a dissipative hydrological model for the Hotan Oasis (DHMHO) was developed. It was an outcome of years of systematic study on the moisture transformation in arid areas and on the water-land conditions in the Hotan Oasis. Based on statistics, DHMHO introduces two empirical equations whereby we dynamically calibrated model parameters with monthly data from year 1971 to 1995. Then the calibrated parameters were used to model the moisture movement from 1996 to 2003 and thereafter rationality check and error analysis were conducted. The error analysis results show that the absolute relative errors between simulated and observed groundwater depth values are almost (11 of 12 points) within 20%, and those in annual watershed outflow simulation are mostly (six of eight points) within 20% with an average annual Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSEC) of 0.80. With DHMHO and IPCC assessment, we also simulated the moisture transformation and dissipation in the Hotan Oasis from the year 2011 to 2020. Results show details of the water resources in the Hotan Oasis in the next decade and hence are expected to provide scientific references for establishing rational exploitation and allocation policies on the local water-land resources in the future.\",\"[Zhao, Changsen] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Water Resources & Environm, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Changsen; Shen, Bing; Huang, Lingmei] Xian Univ Technol, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Lei, Zhidong; Hu, Heping; Yang, Shixiu] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China\",\"Zhao, CS (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Water Resources & Environm, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.\",hzjohnson2003@163.com; shenbing@xaut.edu.cn,\"Zhao, Changsen/C-8107-2011\",,Natural Science Foundation of China [50779052],\"This study was supported by Project of the Natural Science Foundation of China ( No. 50779052).

The paper starts by ascertaining why agricultural and food systems need to change systemically. Evidence from case studies in fourteen countries is used to explore the possibilities for, and drivers and limitations of systemic change in four thematic areas: the resilience of farms and rural areas; prosperity and well-being; knowledge and innovation, and; the governance of agriculture and rural areas. In each area, we identify a major mismatch between visions and strategies on the one hand, and market developments, policy measures and outcomes on the other. The first theme is of growing concern as there has been an observable decrease in the social-ecological resilience of farms and of rural communities in recent decades. The second theme emerges as important as the concentration of production in some regions or some farms is directly linked to the marginalisation of others. The third theme illustrates that local farmer-driven innovations can teach us much, especially since farmers focus on efficiently using the resources available to them, including their location-specific experiential knowledge. Through the final theme we show that informal networks can balance different interests and approaches, which is essential for integrated rural development strategies and projects. Our findings in these four thematic areas have implications for the strategic frameworks and policy of the EU (and beyond) and future research agendas. We explicitly draw these out. The 14 case studies show that practitioners, grassroots initiatives and pilot programmes are already generating a wealth of experiences and knowledge that could be fruitfully used to inform higher-level policy development. The paper concludes that systemic change requires more critical reflection of conventional wisdom and approaches, and openness to ideas and practices that are outside the mainstream.

Using UK cider apple orchards (Mains domestica Borkhausen) as a model system, we assessed whether flower strips increased pollination services in orchards. Pollinator communities (visual observation) and pollination services (fruit set) were assessed at increasing distance from surrounding semi-natural habitats (0-200 m) in eight orchards. In four orchards, perennial flower strips had been established and bloomed in the year before the main experiment. In a separate experiment, insect visits to apple flowers were observed to investigate possible functional mechanisms underpinning pollinator efficacy. The visit rate of wild insects to apple flowers (non-Apis bees and flies), but not that of honeybees (Apis mellifera L.), increased by 40% in flower strip orchards compared to control orchards, particularly in areas close to semi-natural habitat (<100 m). Wild insect visitation was also positively related to dandelion (Taraxacum species) abundance in orchards. Fruit set in orchards was positively related to wild insect richness, and andrenid bee (Andrena species) visitation, but neither richness nor andrenid bee visit rate responded positively to flower strips. Wild bees (andrenid bees and bumblebees (Bombus species)) contacted apple stigma (95 and 100% of visits) more often than honeybees (81%), but only bumblebees moved frequently between different tree rows, an important trait for transfer of compatible pollen in apples. Our results demonstrate that flower strips enhanced overall wild insect abundance but not pollination services in cider orchards. Positive effects of ground flora on wild insect abundance in orchards suggest that flower mixtures or orchard management could be optimised for andrenid bees, the single most important pollinator taxa, by increasing the availability of early-flowering plants in orchards. Equally, wild insect richness was highest in areas close to semi-natural habitats. Therefore, whilst flower strips can boost abundance of the existing species pool, only large scale preservation of (semi-) natural habitat will maintain pollinator diversity in apple orchards.

With the development of urbanization, the exploitation and utilization of coasts have become important issues in the debate. To evaluate variations in the intensity of the land resource exploitation of coastal zones, an index-based model has been proposed in this paper, and coastal Vietnam has been established as the study area. The model is based on four normalized indexes to realize rapid evaluation of the spatial distribution of the exploitative intensity after zoning. The model was established to characterize the different exploitative intensities in different segments of the coast and to graphically present a sequence of decision choices for decision-makers. The results are as follows. (1) The simplicity and rapidity of the index operations can address the fast-changing characteristics of coastal exploitation and meet the desired precision. (2) The choices of the landward buffers fit well with the banded characteristics of the coastal zone. The buffers are horizontally divided into equidistant subregions, which can quantify the spatial differentiation of the exploitative intensity along the coast and perpendicular to the coast. (3) The average exploitative intensity is low, and the proportion of area that is to be exploited accounts for approximately 50%.Considering its spatial variation from north to south, the land exploitative intensity in the north is higher than that in the south. Compared to the intensity of land resource exploitation in the 20 km and 10 km buffers, the land exploitative intensity in the 5 km buffer is higher. The state of the intensity of land resource exploitation and how it can be used by stakeholders to manage coastal resources are then discussed.\",\"[Wang, Wenyue; Zhang, Junjue; Su, Fenzhen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, LREIS, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wenyue; Zhang, Junjue] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wenyue; Zhang, Junjue; Su, Fenzhen] Collaborat Innovat Ctr South China Sea Studies, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junjue] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China\",\"Su, FZ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, LREIS, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Su, FZ (reprint author), Collaborat Innovat Ctr South China Sea Studies, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.\",295467710@qq.com; sufz@lreis.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41421001],\"National Natural Science Foundation of China, No. 41421001\",,47.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,19.0,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,\"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA\",1009-637X,1861-9568,,J GEOGR SCI,J.

No genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been reported for smoking behaviors in Hispanics/Latinos in the United States and Latin America, who are of mixed ancestry with European, African, and American Indigenous components. Methods: We examined genetic associations with smoking behaviors in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) (N = 12 741 with smoking data, 5119 ever-smokers), using similar to 2.3 million genotyped variants imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3. Mixed logistic regression models accounted for population structure, sampling, relatedness, sex, and age. Results: The known region of CHRNA5, which encodes the alpha 5 cholinergic nicotinic receptor subunit, was associated with heavy smoking at genome-wide significance (p <= 5 x 10(-8)) in a comparison of 1929 ever-smokers reporting cigarettes per day (CPD) > 10 versus 3156 reporting CPD <= 10. The functional variant rs16969968 in CHRNA5 had a p value of 2.20 x 10(-7) and odds ratio (OR) of 1.32 for the minor allele (A); its minor allele frequency was 0.22 overall and similar across Hispanic/Latino background groups (Central American = 0.17; South American = 0.19; Mexican = 0.18; Puerto Rican = 0.22; Cuban = 0.29; Dominican = 0.19). CHRNA4 on chromosome 20 attained p < 10(-4), supporting prior findings in non-Hispanics. For nondaily smoking, which is prevalent in Hispanic/Latino smokers, compared to daily smoking, loci on chromosomes 2 and 4 achieved genome-wide significance; replication attempts were limited by small Hispanic/Latino sample sizes. Conclusions: Associations of nicotinic receptor gene variants with smoking, first reported in non-Hispanic European-ancestry populations, generalized to Hispanics/Latinos despite different patterns of smoking behavior.\",\"[Saccone, Nancy L.; Duan, Weimin] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Campus Box 8232, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Emery, Leslie S.; Sofer, Tamar; Gogarten, Stephanie M.; Louie, Tin; Stilp, Adrienne M.; Szpiro, Adam A.; Laurie, Cathy C.] Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Becker, Diane M.; Yanek, Lisa R.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, GeneSTAR Res Program, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Bottinger, Erwin P.; Loos, Ruth J.

Our paper summarizes concepts that provide a basis for making strategic and operational silvicultural decisions that insure sustainability when applying intensive management of forest plantations. In addition, we include new information in areas where there are knowledge gaps in forest plantation management. Recent Findings Intensive management of forest plantations increasingly incorporates large-scale precision silviculture to estimate silvicultural, biotic, and abiotic effects on site-specific forest productivity. Remote sensing measurements combined with strategically located ground information provide spatial modeling tools needed for this type of silviculture. Long-term field experiments, which are a part of this methodology, provide a mechanistic understanding of environmental and silvicultural effects on forest production that is required for the models driving silvicultural decisions. The focus on maximizing production will challenge scientific efforts to alleviate concerns about intensive land use and to provide solutions for water use conflicts while maintaining long-term productivity and sustainability. Future work will need to develop a better understanding of genetic x environment x silvicultural (G x E x S) interactions to improve productivity and simultaneously provide improved ecosystem services. Summary New silviculture technology combines remote sensing information with ground data to model resource availability and limitations to forest productivity. Understanding G x E x S permits successful implementation of these new silvicultural technologies. An improved understanding of G x E x S will provide practical tools that may be incorporated into our scientific and technical models while providing robust economic sustainability.\",\"[Rubilar, Rafael A.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Forestales, Dept Silvicultura, Cooperat Productividad Forestal, Concepcion, Chile; [Allen, H.

This paper describes the implementation of a comprehensive tobacco-free workplace program at a behavioral healthcare community center in Texas. The center participated in a tobacco-free workplace program implementation project that provided guidance and resources and allowed center autonomy in implementation. Six employee-based subcommittees guided implementation of program components including consumer and staff surveys, policy development, signage, tobacco use assessments, communication, and nicotine replacement distribution. Timeline development, successes, challenges, lessons learned, and sustainability initiatives are delineated. Concerns about the tobacco-free workplace policy from the center's staff and consumers were gradually replaced by strong support for the initiative. Program success was enabled by consistent support from the center's leadership, publicity of program efforts, and educational campaigns. The center surpassed the program expectations when it adopted a tobacco-free hiring policy, which was not an initial program goal. This center's path to a tobacco-free workplace provides an implementation and sustainability model for other behavioral health community centers and other organizations to become tobacco free.\",\"[Correa-Fernandez, Virmarie; Samaha, Hannah L.; Reitzel, Lorraine R.] Univ Houston, Dept Psychol Hlth & Learning Sci, 491 Farish Hall, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Wilson, William T.; Kyburz, Bryce; Stacey, Timothy; Williams, Teresa] Austin Travis Cty Integral Care, 1430 Collier St, Austin, TX 78704 USA; [Shedrick, Deborah A.] Spindletop Ctr, 655 S 8th St, Beaumont, TX 77701 USA; [Lam, Cho Y.] Huntsman Canc Inst, Room 359,383 Colorow Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84108 USA; [Lam, Cho Y.] Univ Utah, Hlth Sci Ctr, Room 359,383 Colorow Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84108 USA\",\"Correa-Fernandez, V (reprint author), Univ Houston, Dept Psychol Hlth & Learning Sci, 491 Farish Hall, Houston, TX 77204 USA.\",vcorreaf@central.uh.edu,,\"Correa-Fernandez, Virmarie/0000-0003-2548-1085\",Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) [PP130032]; American Cancer Society [MRSG-15-018-01-CPPB]; CPRIT grant [PP160081],\"The work described herein was part of the Taking Texas Tobaco Free program, which was funded by prevention grant PP130032 from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT; to LRR and CYL).

Despite its relative scarcity and absolute importance to life on earth, fresh water resources are often used inefficiently or polluted unnecessarily. Policymakers must work towards developing approaches to balance human demands for water with the water requirements of ecosystems. The European Water Framework Directive, which aims to encourage the sustainable management and protection of freshwater resources, brings this agenda into sharp focus in Europe. Land use change and environmental quality are closely related, and the nature and location of development can significantly influence both the generation and resolution of environmental problems. This places spatial planning, which provides a framework for regulating the development and use of land, in a strong position to affect water quantity and quality issues and thus to aid the achievement of the Directive's goals. In particular, spatial planning has an important function in integrating the use and management of land and water more closely than is presently the case. This paper explores the potential and actual role of spatial planning in addressing challenges associated with the water environment. This enables an assessment to be made of the extent to which spatial planning can help to meet the goals of the Water Framework Directive.\",\"Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England\",\"Carter, JG (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.\",jeremy.carter@manchester.ac.uk,,\"Carter, Jeremy/0000-0003-1640-3747\",,,,33.0,27.0,28.0,0.0,16.0,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,\"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA\",0016-7398,1475-4959,,GEOGR J,Geogr.

Yet unmet need among rural women (28.6%) is almost double that of urban women (15.5%), with a wide gap in total fertility rate depending on urban (2.6) or rural (5.5) residence. This study investigates the impact of a service delivery model that combines community-based distribution (CBD) of contraception with social marketing in Tigray, Ethiopia, to create a more sustainable approach to CBD. Between September 2011 and October 2013, 626 volunteer CHWs were recruited and trained to administer depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injections and provide counseling and referrals to the health post for other methods; the project implementation period ended in June 2014. The CHWs received a supply of DMPA injections in the form of a microloan from a drug revolving fund; the CHWs charged women a minimal fee (5 birr, or US$0.29), determined based on willingness-to-pay data, for each DMPA injection; and the CHWs returned part of the fee (3 birr) to the drug revolving fund while keeping the remaining portion (2 birr). The CHWs also promoted demand for family planning through door-to-door outreach and community meetings. Existing health extension workers (HEWs) provided regular supervision of the CHWs, supplemented by in-depth supervision visits from study coordinators. Baseline and endline representative surveys of women of reproductive age, as well as of participating CHWs, were conducted. In addition, DMPA provision data from the CHWs were collected. Between October 2011 and June 2014, the CHWs served in total 8,604 women and administered an estimated 15,410 DMPA injections, equivalent to providing 3,853 couple-years of protection. There was a 25% significant increase in contraceptive use among surveyed women, from 30.1% at baseline to 37.7% at endline, with DMPA use largely responsible for this increase. Changes in quality of family planning markers from baseline suggested services improved between baseline and endline: nearly 50% more women reported being told about side effects and what to do if they experience side effects, and 25% more women said they were told about other methods of contraception. The results from household surveys at baseline and endline suggest that CHWs in this model made a significant contribution to family planning in the region.\",\"[Weidert, Karen; Prataa, Ndola] Univ Calif Berkeley, Bixby Ctr Populat Hlth & Sustainabil, Sch Publ Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gessessew, Amanuel] Mekelle Univ Coll Hlth Sci, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Bell, Suzanne] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Godefay, Hagos] Tigray Reg Hlth Bur, Mekelle, Tigray, Ethiopia\",\"Prataa, N (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Bixby Ctr Populat Hlth & Sustainabil, Sch Publ Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.\",ndola@berkeley.edu,,,\"Joffe Charitable Trust; Bixby Center for Population, Health and Sustainability; Rotary International\",\"Funding for this study was provided by the Joffe Charitable Trust, the Bixby Center for Population, Health and Sustainability, and Rotary International.\",,37.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,US AGENCY INT DEVELOPMENT-USAID,BALTIMORE,\"US AGENCY INT DEVELOPMENT-USAID, BALTIMORE, MD 00000 USA\",2169-575X,,,GLOB HEALTH-SCI PRAC,Glob.

This paper represents an attempt to study the source and transportation of such pollutants in estuarine and coastal environments as an integrated ecosystem, by determining the levels of 18 OCl insecticides, 21 PCB congeners, and 17 OP insecticides in the Pearl River Estuary and South China Sea. The total concentrations varied from 126-1198 ng l(-1) for OCl insecticides, 33.38-1064 ng l(-1) for PCB congeners, and 4.44-6356 ng l(-1) for OP insecticides in the Pearl River Estuary. In comparison, their levels in the South China Sea were significantly lower, varying from 57.09-202 ng l(-1) for OCl insecticides, 21.72-144 ng l(-1) for PCBs, and 1.27-122 ng l(-1) for OP insecticides, respectively. The predominance of beta-HCH in HCHs, and DDE in DDTs in all water samples was clearly observed, suggesting beta-HCH and DDE's resistance to further degradation. The PCBs were dominated by those with 3-6 chlorines. The distribution characteristic of OP insecticides shows that five compounds (methamidophos, dimethoate, malathion, dichlorvos and omethoate) accounted for 56% and 72% of the total OP insecticide concentration. The relationship between pollutant concentrations and salinity in the estuary showed that they were all removed during the mixing process, therefore behaving non-conservatively.\",\"Univ Sussex, Sch Chem Phys & Environm Sci, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England; Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Tsinghua POPs Res Ctr, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; Xiamen Univ, Environm Sci Res Ctr, Minist Educ, Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China\",\"Zhou, JL (reprint author), Univ Sussex, Sch Chem Phys & Environm Sci, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England.\",,\"Dai, Minhan/G-3343-2010; Hong, HS/G-3347-2010; Yu, Gang/H-1010-2013; Yu, Gang/H-6354-2013; Zhang, Zulin/B-2879-2010\",\"Dai, Minhan/0000-0003-0550-0701; \",,,\"Chevreuil M., 1985, AQUAT TOXICOL, V7, P217; Colborn T, 1996, REV ENVIRON CONTAM T, V146, P91; COOPER CM, 1991, J FRESHWATER ECOL, V6, P237, DOI 10.1080/02705060.1991.9665300; Dannenberger D, 1996, MAR POLLUT BULL, V32, P772, DOI 10.1016/S0025-326X(96)00029-X; DUINKER JC, 1988, MAR POLLUT BULL, V19, P19, DOI 10.1016/0025-326X(88)90748-5; El-Kabbany S, 2000, J HAZARD MATER, V72, P11, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3894(99)00174-0; Fu J, 2001, WATER SCI TECHNOL, V43, P83; Hong HS, 1999, MAR POLLUT BULL, V39, P376, DOI 10.1016/S0025-326X(99)00081-8; Hope B, 1997, MAR POLLUT BULL, V34, P548, DOI 10.1016/S0025-326X(96)00180-4; IWATA H, 1994, ENVIRON POLLUT, V85, P15, DOI 10.1016/0269-7491(94)90234-8; IWATA H, 1995, ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL, V29, P792, DOI 10.1021/es00003a030; KAMMERBAUER J, 1998, ENVIRON POLLUT, V103, P1471; Kang YH, 2000, MAR POLLUT BULL, V40, P794, DOI 10.1016/S0025-326X(00)00089-8; Liess M, 1999, WATER RES, V33, P239, DOI 10.1016/S0043-1354(98)00174-2; MacDonald RW, 2000, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V254, P93, DOI 10.1016/S0048-9697(00)00434-4; Mai BX, 2002, ENVIRON POLLUT, V117, P457, DOI 10.1016/S0269-7491(01)00193-2; Mai BX, 2001, APPL GEOCHEM, V16, P1429; MANSINGH A, 1995, MAR POLLUT BULL, V30, P640, DOI 10.1016/0025-326X(95)00038-O; Meharg AA, 1998, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V210, P219, DOI 10.1016/S0048-9697(98)00014-X; Perez-Ruzafa A, 2000, MAR POLLUT BULL, V40, P140, DOI 10.1016/S0025-326X(99)00193-9; PRATS D, 1992, MAR POLLUT BULL, V24, P441, DOI 10.1016/0025-326X(92)90343-5; Ragnarsdottir KV, 2000, J GEOL SOC LONDON, V157, P859, DOI 10.1144/jgs.157.4.859; Sujatha CH, 1999, WATER RES, V33, P109, DOI 10.1016/S0043-1354(98)00188-2; TANABE S, 1994, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V154, P163, DOI 10.1016/0048-9697(94)90086-8; Wong CK, 1995, ENV RES PEARL RIVER, P1; Wu Y, 1999, ENVIRON POLLUT, V105, P143, DOI 10.1016/S0269-7491(98)00160-2; Yang YH, 1997, ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS, V44, P569, DOI 10.1023/A:1005743932046; ZHANG YB, 1999, INSECTICIDE, V38, P1; Zhang Z, 2001, THESIS XIAMEN U XIAM; Zhang ZL, 2002, J ENVIRON MONITOR, V4, P435, DOI 10.1039/b111204j; Zhang ZuLin, 2002, Marine Pollution Bulletin, V45, P397, DOI 10.1016/S0025-326X(02)00094-2; Zhou JL, 2000, WATER RES, V34, P2132, DOI 10.1016/S0043-1354(99)00360-7; Zhou JL, 2001, ENVIRON POLLUT, V113, P373, DOI 10.1016/S0269-7491(00)00180-9; Zhou JL, 1996, MAR POLLUT BULL, V32, P599, DOI 10.1016/0025-326X(96)00014-8; ZHOU MY, 1992, ENV ORGANIC POLLUTIO; ZOEST R, 1990, NETHERLANDS J SEA RE, V26, P89\",36.0,42.0,58.0,2.0,36.0,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,\"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND\",1464-0325,,,J ENVIRON MONITOR,J.

MODELm was able to predict the degree of metal ion complexation by humic acid over a range of metal ion loadings in good agreement with reported experimental data. When compared with the widely used speciation code MINTEQA2. MODELm predicted a much greater amount of metal-NOM complexation under given conditions, and a marked dependence of the extent of metal-NOM complexation on the concentration of NOM.

Data were collected via survey from a representative subset of Canadian egg farms, and evaluated against a novel suite of indicators and performance reference points developed for relevance in the Canadian context. The evaluation focused on interactions with four stakeholder groups (Workers; Local Communities; Value Chain Partners; and Society) in eighteen thematic areas. This assessment resulted in a rich and highly nuanced characterization of the potential social risks and benefits attributable to contemporary egg production facilities in Canada. Overall, risks were low and benefits were identified for Local Communities, Value Chain Partners, and Society stakeholder groups, but mixed for the Workers stakeholder group. With respect to the latter, identified areas of higher risk are related, in particular, to a subset of indicators for Working Hours, Equal Opportunities and Fair Salary. As such, the results suggest opportunities and strategies for the Canadian egg industry both to capitalize on its current successes as well as to proactively engage in improving its social sustainability profile. The study also contributes a novel set of social sustainability metrics for use and continued development in the Canadian egg sector as well as other agri-food sectors in Canada and beyond. The inevitable challenge in social life cycle assessment (LCA) of developing non-arbitrary performance reference points for social indicators for which clear norms do not exist, and similarly for establishing non-arbitrary scales and thresholds for differentiating between performance levels, is underscored. A necessary next step with respect to the methods presented herein is for stakeholder groups to carefully consider and refine the performance reference points and characterization thresholds that have been developed, in order to assess their alignment with context-specific social sustainability priorities for this industry, and also to extend the analysis to encompass other value chain stages to enable a full social life cycle assessment.\",\"[Pelletier, Nathan] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Fac Management, Ind Res Chair Sustainabil,Dept Biol, Nat Sci & Engn Res Council Canada NSERC,Egg Farme, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada\",\"Pelletier, N (reprint author), Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Fac Management, Ind Res Chair Sustainabil,Dept Biol, Nat Sci & Engn Res Council Canada NSERC,Egg Farme, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.\",nathan.pelletier@ubc.ca,,,Egg Farmers of Canada; NSERC/Egg Farmers of Canada Industrial Research Chair in Sustainability,This research was funded by Egg Farmers of Canada.

The attainment of isotopic equilibrium during melting of crustal rocks is implicitly assumed in most isotopic dating and tracing studies. This assumption considers the melting event as an instantaneous process and does not take into account the duration of anatexis. To assess the critical role of the timescale of crustal melting, we have studied the unique occurrence of erupted migmatites enclosed as xenoliths in the El Hoyazo and Mazarron dacites of the Neogene Volcanic Province of SE Spain. These xenoliths represent the residue after some 30-60 % rhyolitic melt extraction at P-T conditions of 5-7 kbar and similar to 850 degrees C, and consist of biotite, plagioclase, sillimanite, garnet, cordierite, graphite and abundant glass inclusions (i.e., not extracted rhyolitic melt) within each mineral phase. The timescale of melt extraction was similar to 3 Myr and < 0.8 Myr at El Hoyazo and Mazarron, respectively, resembling the duration of melting events during rapid anatexis caused by basalt underplating and crustal assimilation processes. In both localities, the minerals and glass inclusions of erupted migmatites preserve a significant Sr and minor Nd isotope disequilibrium. At Mazarron the isotopic disequilibrium is most marked owing to the shorter residence time of the melt within the source. The isotopic disequilibrium is not caused by the major xenolith-forming minerals but rather by the accessory phosphate inclusions (apatite +/- monazite +/- xenotime) hosted in garnet and biotite. The preservation of isotopic disequilibrium in these accessory phases has been facilitated by both their intrinsically low Sr and Nd diffusion coefficients and the armouring effect caused by their occurrence within biotite and garnet crystals, which acted as chemical barriers to Sr and Nd diffusion. This result implies that modelling of radiogenic isotope equilibration in natural systems should consider elemental diffusion in a composite medium with a resistance at the interface, i.e. different partition coefficients between adjacent mineral phases.\",\"[Perini, Giulia; Ghezzi, Lorenzo; Tommasini, Simone] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Cesare, Bernardo] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Geosci, I-35137 Padua, Italy; [Cesare, Bernardo] Ist Geosci Georisorse, Sez Padova, CNR, I-35137 Padua, Italy; [Ghezzi, Lorenzo] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Granada 18002, Spain; [Gomez-Pugnaire, Maria Teresa] CSIC, Inst Andaluz Ciencias Tierra, Granada 18002, Spain\",\"Tommasini, S (reprint author), Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Via Pira 4, I-50121 Florence, Italy.\",toms@unifi.it,\"Tommasini, Simone/G-6741-2012; Gomez-Pugnaire, Maria Teresa/C-8890-2015\",\"Gomez-Pugnaire, Maria Teresa/0000-0003-4730-9139; Tommasini, Simone/0000-0002-4670-5888\",\"European Science Foundation [ERAS-CT-2003-980409]; European Commission; Italian MIUR [PRIN 2005-047810]; Junta de Andalucia [CGL-2006-04440, RMN-145]\",\"We thank Antonio Acosta-Vigil and Sandro Conticelli for discussion and critical reading of an early version of the manuscript.

The Virtual Supermarket Program (VSP) is a Baltimore City Health Department program that uses online grocery ordering to deliver food to low-income neighborhoods. This study evaluates stakeholder preferences and barriers of program implementation. Methods: This study assessed the feasibility, sustainability and efficacy of the VSP by surveying 93 customers and interviewing 14 programmatic stakeholders who had recently used the VSP or been involved with program design and implementation. Results: We identified the following themes: The VSP addressed transportation barriers and food availability. The VSP impacted customers and the city by including improving food purchasing behavior, creating a food justice \"\"brand for the city\"\", and fostering a sense of community. Customers appreciated using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to pay for groceries, but policy changes are needed allow online processing of SNAP benefits. Conclusions: This evaluation summarizes lessons learned and serves as a guide to other public health leaders interested in developing similar programs. Provisions in the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Farm Bill 2014 allow for select grocers to pilot online transactions with SNAP benefits. If these pilots are efficacious, the VSP model could be easily disseminated.\",\"[Lagisetty, Pooja; Heisler, Michele; Forman, Jane] Univ Michigan, Div Gen Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lagisetty, Pooja; Heisler, Michele; Forman, Jane] Univ Michigan, VA Ann Arbor Ctr Clin Management Res, North Campus Res Ctr, 2800 Plymouth Rd,Bldg 16,Rm 345E, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lagisetty, Pooja; Heisler, Michele] Univ Michigan, Inst Hlth Policy & Innovat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Flamm, Laura; Rak, Summer] Baltimore City Dept Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Landgraf, Jessica] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA\",\"Lagisetty, P (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Div Gen Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Lagisetty, P (reprint author), Univ Michigan, VA Ann Arbor Ctr Clin Management Res, North Campus Res Ctr, 2800 Plymouth Rd,Bldg 16,Rm 345E, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Lagisetty, P (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Inst Hlth Policy & Innovat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.\",lagiset@med.umich.edu,,,Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program,For this study was provided by the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program.,,14.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,8.0,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,\"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND\",1471-2458,,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,BMC Public Health,OCT 23,2017.0,17,,,,,,,,837,10.1186/s12889-017-4864-9,,,,9.0,\"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health\",\"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health\",FK4OR,WOS:000413475600006,29061141.0,gold,,,2018-07-06\n",

In this review, we compile archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data from East Africa to document land-cover change, and environmental, subsistence and land-use transitions, over the past 6000 years. Throughout East Africa there have been a series of relatively rapid and high-magnitude environmental shifts characterised by changing hydrological budgets during the mid- to late Holocene. For example, pronounced environmental shifts that manifested as a marked change in the rainfall amount or seasonality and subsequent hydrological budget throughout East Africa occurred around 4000, 800 and 300 radiocarbon years before present (yr BP). The past 6000 years have also seen numerous shifts in human interactions with East African ecologies. From the mid-Holocene, land use has both diversified and increased exponentially, this has been associated with the arrival of new subsistence systems, crops, migrants and technologies, all giving rise to a sequence of significant phases of land-cover change. The first large-scale human influences began to occur around 4000 yr BP, associated with the introduction of domesticated livestock and the expansion of pastoral communities. The first widespread and intensive forest clearances were associated with the arrival of iron-using early farming communities around 2500 yr BP, particularly in productive and easily-cleared mid-altitudinal areas. Extensive and pervasive land-cover change has been associated with population growth, immigration and movement of people. The expansion of trading routes between the interior and the coast, starting around 1300 years ago and intensifying in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries CE, was one such process. These caravan routes possibly acted as conduits for spreading New World crops such as maize (Zea mays), tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum), although the processes and timings of their introductions remains poorly documented. The introduction of southeast Asian domesticates, especially banana (Musa spp.), rice (Oryza spp.), taro (Colocasia esculenta), and chicken (Gallus gallus), via transoceanic biological transfers around and across the Indian Ocean, from at least around 1300 yr BP, and potentially significantly earlier, also had profound social and ecological consequences across parts of the region. Through an interdisciplinary synthesis of information and metadatasets, we explore the different drivers and directions of changes in land-cover, and the associated environmental histories and interactions with various cultures, technologies, and subsistence strategies through time and across space in East Africa. This review suggests topics for targeted future research that focus on areas and/or time periods where our understanding of the interactions between people, the environment and land-cover change are most contentious and/or poorly resolved. The review also offers a perspective on how knowledge of regional land-use change can be used to inform and provide perspectives on contemporary issues such as climate and ecosystem change models, conservation strategies, and the achievement of nature-based solutions for development purposes.\",\"[Marchant, Rob;

Old paradigms that view humans as separate from nature, natural resources as inexhaustible or endlessly substitutable, and the world as stable, predictable, and in balance are no longer tenable. New conceptual frameworks are rapidly emerging based on an adaptive approach that focuses on learning and flexible management in a dynamic social-ecological landscape. Using two iconic World Heritage Areas as case studies (the Great Barrier Reef and the Grand Canyon) we outline how an improved integration of the scientific and social aspects of natural resource management can guide the evolution of multiscale systems of governance that confront and cope with uncertainty, risk, and change in an increasingly human-dominated world.\",\"James Cook Univ N Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Emory Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Univ Manitoba, Inst Nat Resources, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; Univ Adelaide, Sch Math Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Stockholm Univ, Dept Syst Ecol, Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Wageningen, Dept Environm Sci, NL-6700 DD Wageningen, Netherlands; Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Sch Marine Sci, Walpole, ME 04573 USA; Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; CSIRO Sustaonable Ecosyst, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA; Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS, Canada\",\"Hughes, TP (reprint author), James Cook Univ N Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.\",Terry.Hughes@jcu.eclu.au; lgunder@emory.edu; carl.folke@beijer.kva.se; andrew.baird@jcu.edu.au; David.Bellwood@jcu.edu.au; berkes@cc.umanitoba.ca; beatrice@ecology.su.se; ariella.helfgott@adelaide.edu.au; hleslie@princeton.edu; jon.norberg@ecology.su.se; magnusn@ecology.su.se; per@ctm.su.se; henriko@ecology.su.se; Marten.Scheffer@wur.nl; heidi.schuttenberg@jcu.edu.au; Steneck@Maine.edu; mtengo@ecology.su.se; max@beijer.kva.se; Brian.Walker@csiro.au; jwilson@Maine.edu; bworm@dal.ca,\"Walker, Brian/F-2386-2011; Scheffer, Marten/C-1852-2012; Hughes, Terry/L-4721-2013; Osterblom, Henrik/D-4249-2012; Baird, Andrew/C-8449-2009\",\"Hughes, Terry/0000-0002-5257-5063; Baird, Andrew/0000-0001-8504-4077; Osterblom, Henrik/0000-0002-1913-5197; Tengo, Maria/0000-0002-4776-3748; Nystrom, Magnus/0000-0003-3608-2426; Troell, Max/0000-0002-7509-8140; Leslie, Heather/0000-0003-4512-9417; Olsson, Per/0000-0002-9038-4786; Folke, Carl/0000-0002-4050-3281; Norberg, Jon/0000-0003-1861-5030\",,,,41.0,46.0,47.0,3.0,26.0,ROYAL SWEDISH ACAD SCIENCES,STOCKHOLM,\"BOX 50005, S-104 05 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN\",0044-7447,,,AMBIO,Ambio,NOV,2007.0,36,7,,,,,586,592,,10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[586:AMOTGB]2.0.CO;2,,,,7.0,\"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences\",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,231QB,WOS:000250963000013,18074897.0,,,,2018-07-06\n",

The CHWs (Mitanins) have consistently adopted roles that go beyond health programme-specific interventions to embrace community mobilization and action on local priorities. The aim of this research was to document how and why the Mitanins have been able to act on the social determinants of health, describing the catalysts and processes involved and the enabling programmatic and organizational factors. A qualitative comparative case study of successful action by Mitanin was conducted in two 'blocks', purposefully selected as positive exemplars in two districts of Chhattisgarh. One case focused on malnutrition and the other on gender-based violence. Data collection involved 17 in-depth interviews and 10 group interviews with the full range of stakeholders in both blocks, including community members and programme team. Thematic analysis was done using a broad conceptual framework that was further refined. Action on social determinants involved raising awareness on rights, mobilizing women's collectives, revitalizing local political structures and social action targeting both the community and government service providers. Through these processes, the Mitanins developed identities as agents of change and advocates for the community, both with respect to local cultural and gender norms and in ensuring accountability of service providers. The factors underpinning successful action on social determinants were identified as the significance of the original intent and vision of the programme, and how this was carried through into all aspects of programme design, the role of the Mitanins and their identification with village women, ongoing training and support, and the relative autonomy of the programme. Although the results are not narrowly generalizable and do not necessarily represent the situation of the Mitanin Programme as a whole, the explanatory framework may provide general lessons for programmes in similar contexts.\",\"[Nandi, Sulakshana] Publ Hlth Resource Network, Raipur 492001, Chhattisgarh, India; [Schneider, Helen] Univ Western Cape, Sch Publ Hlth, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa\",\"Nandi, S (reprint author), Publ Hlth Resource Network, 28 Near Katora Talab, Raipur 492001, Chhattisgarh, India.\",sulakshana.nandi@gmail.com,,,Public Health Resource Society; ICICI Foundation for Inclusive Growth-Centre for Child Health and Nutrition (IFIG-CCHN),Partial funding support was provided by Public Health Resource Society and its funders ICICI Foundation for Inclusive Growth-Centre for Child Health and Nutrition (IFIG-CCHN) for the MPH course for which this study had been undertaken.,,50.0,11.0,11.0,0.0,9.0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,\"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND\",0268-1080,1460-2237,,HEALTH POLICY PLANN,Health Policy Plan.,OCT,2014.0,29,,,2,,,71,81,,10.1093/heapol/czu074,,,,11.0,Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Health Care Sciences & Services,AR2KW,WOS:000343415600008,,gold_or_bronze,,,2018-07-03\n",

Bioassessment has evolved significantly from a method of deciding whether an ecosystem exposed to stressors should 'pass' or 'fail' (or how badly it fails). Society wants some notion of what has caused any observed degradation of ecosystems, and what management strategies might improve degraded ecosystems. Managers also want to predict what negative or positive effects different land use strategies will have on the component ecosystems of a landscape, including lakes and streams. 2. Here we illustrate an approach to providing these tools to managers with data from a bioassessment study of streams in the Fraser River Basin of British Columbia, Canada. 3. Landscape scale descriptors of both the natural (e.g. catchment size, surficial geology) and stressor (e.g. hard rock mines, forest harvest) environment of each site were used to define the natural and stressor environments of each of the 242 stream sites. 4. We classified 206 reference (relatively unexposed to human activity) sites using their benthic macroinvertebrate community composition, and then discriminated among the faunally defined groups with landscape scale descriptors of the natural environment of the sites. 5. This discriminant function model allowed us to predict which group each of the test sites would be in if it were in reference condition, and then measure the relationship between the amount of human activity and the biota in each of these groups. 6. These relationships were turned into projections of what will happen to a stream ecosystem's biota if the stressor environment is either improved or degraded. These projection models form the basis of evidence-based land use planning that takes into account the health of freshwater ecosystems.\",\"Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; Acadia Univ, Acadia Ctr Estuarine Res, Wolfville, NS B0P 1X0, Canada; Univ Canberra, eWater CRC, Belconnen, ACT 2616, Australia\",\"Bailey, RC (reprint author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.\",drbob@uwo.ca,\"Bailey, Robert/H-6891-2012; Bailey, John/F-8582-2012; Bailey, Robert/D-8538-2012; Linke, Simon/G-5440-2010\",\"Bailey, Robert/0000-0003-3574-0239; Linke, Simon/0000-0002-1797-3947\",,,\"Allan JD, 2004, ANNU REV ECOL EVOL S, V35, P257, DOI 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.35.120202.110122; BAILE RC, 2004, BIOASSESSMENT FRESHW; BARBOUR MT, 1999, 81B99002 USEPA OFF W; Boon PJ, 2000, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V422, P413, DOI 10.1023/A:1017054908152; Brierley GJ, 2000, ENVIRON MANAGE, V25, P661, DOI 10.1007/s002670010052; Brooks RP, 2004, ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS, V94, P9, DOI 10.1023/B:EMAS.0000016876.63062.3d; Brown MT, 2005, ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS, V101, P289, DOI 10.1007/s10661-005-0296-6; Chessman BC, 2004, J N AM BENTHOL SOC, V23, P599, DOI 10.1899/0887-3593(2004)023<0599:BWRSUO>2.0.CO;2; Chessman BC, 1999, FRESHWATER BIOL, V41, P747, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00419.x; Coppolillo P, 2004, BIOL CONSERV, V115, P419, DOI 10.1016/S0006-3207(03)00159-9; CORKUM LD, 1999, AQUAT CONSERV, V9, P599; Danz NP, 2005, ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS, V102, P41, DOI 10.1007/s10661-005-1594-8; Dunham JB, 2003, FOREST ECOL MANAG, V178, P183, DOI 10.1016/S0378-1127(03)00061-6; EBERHARDT LL, 1976, J ENVIRON MANAGE, V4, P27; Fore LS, 1996, J N AM BENTHOL SOC, V15, P212, DOI 10.2307/1467949; FORE LS, 1994, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V51, P1077, DOI 10.1139/f94-107; Gaston KJ, 2002, J BIOSCIENCES, V27, P361, DOI 10.1007/BF02704966; Green RH, 1979, SAMPLING DESIGN STAT; Harding JS, 1998, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V95, P14843, DOI 10.1073/pnas.95.25.14843; Hawkins CP, 2000, ECOL APPL, V10, P1456, DOI 10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[1456:DAEOPM]2.0.CO;2; HUGHES RM, 1986, ENVIRON MANAGE, V10, P629, DOI 10.1007/BF01866767; HURLBERT SH, 1984, ECOL MONOGR, V54, P187, DOI 10.2307/1942661; Hynes HBN., 1975, VERH INT VEREIN LIMN, V19, P1; KARR JR, 1987, ENVIRON MANAGE, V11, P249, DOI 10.1007/BF01867203; Karr JR, 1997, HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS, V3, P993, DOI 10.1080/10807039709383742; Klemm DJ, 2002, ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS, V78, P169, DOI 10.1023/A:1016363718037; Norris RH, 2000, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V435, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:1004176507184; REYNOLDSON TB, 1995, AUST J ECOL, V20, P198, DOI 10.1111/j.1442-9993.1995.tb00532.x; Reynoldson TB, 2001, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V58, P1395, DOI 10.1139/cjfas-58-7-1395; Reynoldson TB, 1997, J N AM BENTHOL SOC, V16, P833, DOI 10.2307/1468175; Simpson Justen C., 2000, P125; Smith MJ, 1999, FRESHWATER BIOL, V41, P269, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00430.x; STEVENSON J, 2004, ECOLOGICAL ASSESSMEN, P85; Stevenson J., 2004, ECOLOGICAL ASSESSMEN, P55; STEWARTOATEN A, 1986, ECOLOGY, V67, P929, DOI 10.2307/1939815; UNDERWOOD AJ, 1991, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V42, P569; Wright J., 1993, EUROPEAN WATER POLLU, V3, P15; WRIGHT JF, 1984, FRESHWATER BIOL, V14, P221, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2427.1984.tb00039.x; Yates AG, 2006, ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS, V114, P257, DOI 10.1007/s10661-006-4779-x\",39.0,18.0,18.0,0.0,53.0,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,\"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND\",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Recently an ion adsorption model has been developed, based on the surface structure of metal (hydr)oxides and the structure of surface complexes identified by spectroscopy. This model has been applied to the adsorption of phosphate and weak organic acids on goethite in single anion systems. We studied the interaction between phosphate and citrate on goethite, which is important for a better understanding of the competitive binding of phosphate and organic matter in natural systems. Citrate adsorption in the presence of phosphate decreased strongly over a wide pH range, whereas phosphate adsorption was only affected at pH values below 7, with the largest interaction around pH 5. Competition for binding sites appeared to be an important factor in determining the competitive adsorption of phosphate and citrate when taking into account that a larger number of surface groups is involved in the complexation of citrate compared with phosphate. Competitive adsorption was predicted satisfactorily by applying model parameters from the single anion experiments, using surface complexes coordinated to three or four surface groups for citrate and to one or two surface groups for phosphate.\",\"Wageningen Univ Agr, Subdept Soil Sci & Plant Nutr, Dept Environm Sci, NL-6700 EC Wageningen, Netherlands\",\"Van Riemsdijk, WH (reprint author), Wageningen Univ Agr, Subdept Soil Sci & Plant Nutr, Dept Environm Sci, POB 8005, NL-6700 EC Wageningen, Netherlands.\",,,,,,,27.0,130.0,139.0,6.0,53.0,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,\"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA\",0013-936X,,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

To avoid conflicts and reach an environmentally sustainable management, various methods have been devised to enable the participation of these actors. Mathematical modelling of river systems is highly recommended to forecast, but we do not always have enough information to do it. In these cases, the soft and meta-models can be valid alternatives to simulate these complex systems. The Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are presented as a tool that facilitates the modelling of ecological systems, functions and services. FCM networking concepts are intertwined through causal relationships. The FCM concept spatial arrangement and the use of fuzzy logic facilitate the integration of different expert opinions. In our study, from a panel of seven experts from representatives of different social sectors, an aggregated FCM was obtained. The most central concept in the aggregated map was cross barriers, dams and weirs. Using our FCM expert model, we performed a number of simulations from different possible scenarios, such as the continuous degradation of natural conditions and the improvement of river natural conditions. A regular increment in the natural conditions generates a substantial enhance in variables as natural water flow and sediment transport. Conversely, the increment in human activities as agro-forestry production addresses to a deterioration of river banks among other variables. In the Esla River, the FCM indicators showed an ecosystem that was greatly influenced by human activity, especially by the presence of barriers, in which the economic variables presented high network influence even though their centrality indices were relatively low. Meanwhile, the essential elements for the proper functioning of this ecosystem, as a natural flow regime, showed very low values that were visibly affected by anthropogenic variables.

This paper focuses on the possibility and the implications of treating the natural environment as a constituent', or internal element, of the concepts of wellbeing and poverty, as opposed to a determinant', or instrumental, external factor. Our review of philosophical accounts and conceptual frameworks of wellbeing and poverty suggests that treating the environment as a constituent element is philosophically sound, conceptually robust and empirically grounded. We argue that failing to consider these missing environmental aspects can result in an incomplete capturing of the multiple dimensions of wellbeing and poverty, and their underlying drivers. This broader framing of the environment-wellbeing relationship has the potential to inform a new generation of individual level wellbeing and poverty indicators, creating measures of multidimensional poverty that reflect the broadened scope ambitiously articulated in the Sustainable Development Goals.

This paper presents an integer linear programming decision support model for the optimal treatment and allocation of water resources. The model seeks to minimize the total water cost which includes the economic cost of treatment and distribution, as well as the associated environmental costs. The model is unique in its ability to account for spatially distributed water supply and demand nodes, as well as multiple water supply (seawater, surface, ground and wastewater) and demand (irrigation, potable, and industrial) types and qualities. It accommodates various treatment technologies, different energy recovery levels, and resource availabilities or capacities. The optimal solution yields volumes of water transported from each supply source to each treatment plant and treated by an appropriate technology in order to satisfy multiple water demands at different required water qualities with the lowest overall economic and environmental costs. The model is applied to a case study. Results showed that the distance of brackish water sources and the environmental cost, observed in terms of carbon savings only, had limited impact on the optimal solution with the demand for the base case being met through a combination of conventional water and wastewater treatment and brackish water reverse osmosis. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the effects of variations in demand/supply volumes as well as variable distances and environmental cost. Sensitivity analysis showed that increased demand under limited resources can be met through the introduction of seawater desalination plants, initially through multi effect distillation combined with residual thermal energy then augmented with seawater reverse osmosis plants with further increase in demand.

Design/methodology/approach The proposed models have been developed using resource-based theory along the integrated supply chain. The models are based on resources sustainability (people, money, material, energy, infrastructure, water, and air), critical factors of sustainability (product, process and policies), sustainability dimensions (environment, economic, and social), and life cycle sustainability (integrated supply chain). Findings The paper presents an integrated assessment system which includes: product life cycle, resources, critical factors (product, process, and policy), key performance indicators, and their interrelationship with sustainability dimensions. The three critical factors and all the important resources required by a manufacturing organization along the integrated supply chain are identified. The readiness assessment model is user friendly and effective to guide the managers to identify the weak areas of sustainability. Research limitations/implications The proposed model for readiness assessment is tested and in an automotive manufacturing organization but the sustainability assessment model is conceptual and it requires validation by implementing the same in an organization to understand its effectiveness. Practical implications The readiness assessment model can help the top management to decide whether the organizational orientation is correct to improve sustainability. The easy to use models can be used by the decision/policy makers and independent bodies to assess, compare and benchmark the products, processes or organizations and thus affect public policies and attitudes. Originality/value This study has developed, for the first time, a sustainability readiness assessment model. The resource-based theory has been applied along the integrated supply chain.\",\"[Sangwan, Kuldip Singh; Bhakar, Vikrant; Digalwar, Abhijeet K.] Birla Inst Technol & Sci, Pilani, Rajasthan, India\",\"Sangwan, KS (reprint author), Birla Inst Technol & Sci, Pilani, Rajasthan, India.\",kss@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in; vikrant.bhakar@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in; akd@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in,,\"Sangwan, Kuldip Singh/0000-0003-4838-734X\",,,,135.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,\"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND\",1463-5771,1758-4094,,BENCHMARKING,Benchmarking,,2018.0,25,3,,,SI,,994,1027,,10.1108/BIJ-08-2017-0227,,,,34.0,Management,Business & Economics,GE2DG,WOS:000431025200013,,,,,2018-07-06\n",

The Global Leader Program for Social Design and Management (GSDM) of the University of Tokyo can be seen as a forerunner in this field. The paper provides definitions of social design as well as of global leadership and provides a proposal for the definition of the objective of the GSDM program, i.e., multi-level resilient human-environment system. These subjects are embedded in the framework of human-environment systems (HES). We identified the different types of knowledge integration that 'global leaders for social design' should master. The core of a sustainable social design is to (1) properly conceptualize and manage \"\"resilient coupled human-environment systems\"\" and to (2) integrate or relate different systems, epistemics, interests, cultures, and knowledge systems. The specific challenge in this context is to cope with conflicting cultural-religious systems or to understand how the vulnerability of different human systems with respect to digital environments. Social design is conceived as all rules, mechanisms, and preferences that govern the interaction of humans with material, biophysical, technological, and socio-cultural epistemic environments. The goal of education for global leadership for social design may have to progress from the T-shaped skills profile (i.e., being specialized in one discipline and having the capability to collaborate with other disciplines) to the pi-profile. Students for leadership in global designs must be qualified in a social and an engineering/natural science and literate and capable to know, relate, and govern different disciplines, cultures, or systems which have to be included in the sustainable transitioning of cultural and socio-technological systems. The paper elaborates in what way transdisciplinarity is needed and why resilience management should be seen as a proper objective of GSDM. The challenges of the new educational program for the science system and institutions as well as for students and professors are discussed.\",\"[Scholz, Roland W.] Danube Univ Krems, Fac Econ & Globalizat, Dept Knowledge & Commun Management, Dr Karl Dorrek Str 30, A-3500 Krems, Austria; [Scholz, Roland W.] ETH Zurich CH, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Nat & Social Sci Interface, Zurich, Switzerland; [Scholz, Roland W.] Fraunhofer IGB, Stuttgart, Germany; [Yarime, Masaru] City Univ Hong Kong, SEE, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yarime, Masaru] UCL, Dept Sci Technol Engn & Publ Policy STEaPP, London, England; [Yarime, Masaru; Shiroyama, Hideaki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Publ Policy GraSPP, Tokyo, Japan\",\"Scholz, RW (reprint author), Danube Univ Krems, Fac Econ & Globalizat, Dept Knowledge & Commun Management, Dr Karl Dorrek Str 30, A-3500 Krems, Austria.; Scholz, RW (reprint author), ETH Zurich CH, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Nat & Social Sci Interface, Zurich, Switzerland.; Scholz, RW (reprint author), Fraunhofer IGB, Stuttgart, Germany.\",roland.scholz@emeritus.ethz.ch,,\"Yarime, Masaru/0000-0001-8048-7354\",,,,115.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,6.0,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,\"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN\",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

The models are effective for exposing anomalies because they play upon basic resource needs and costs in situations where human behavior cannot be observed directly. These decision models are not enough, however, to account for the larger processes by which repeated interactions change the nature of co-evolving species, including humans, and alterations of the conditions of selection across generations. At least two levels of mechanics and their respective temporal domains must be recognized in co-evolutionary studies. These are the primary mechanics of day-to-day decisions and actions, and the compounding mechanics of emergent phenomena that may affect the evolutionary history of populations. Local rules and goals generally govern decisions of individuals or small groups of individuals as they try to balance competing needs. Compounding rules govern emergence of larger phenomena which unfold unpredictably for generations to come. Contra some recent claims, one family of theory cannot replace the function of the other; rather they are complimentary, by speaking to very different scales of phenomena. We develop these points through a consideration of both primary and compounding dynamics in two distinct evolutionary forums: the developmental evolution of the hearth-centered residential camp in the Middle Pleistocene and the \"\"domestic-selective\"\" environment of a formative village at the beginning of the Holocene.

The one-dimensional version of the GHER hydrodynamic model includes heat and momentum exchanges at the air-sea interface. It is coupled with a simple food-web model from the LEPM. A simulation performed with real meteorological data for the year 1985 reproduces reasonably the seasonal phytoplanktonic dynamics and the distribution between diatoms and flagellates. From this simulation, an annual gross primary production integrated over 200 m of 46.4 g C m(-2) year(-1) is computed which is representative of an oligotrophic environment. In order to estimate the relative effect on the gross primary production of the meteorological variability on the one hand and of the initial conditions on the other hand, several runs have been performed for the year 1985 with different conditions of light, wind intensity and nitrate initial quantity. The first simulations are performed with daily and monthly mean solar radiation and wind intensity. An averaging of wind intensity yields a decrease in the gross primary production and leads to unrealistic phytoplankton dynamics. It seems then necessary to take into account the 5-hourly variability of the wind intensity in order to simulate the phytoplankton dynamics with relatively good accuracy. On the other hand, an averaging of the solar radiation leads to an increase in the gross primary production. The following simulations are performed with an increase (decrease) in the solar radiation, the wind intensity or the nitrate initial quantity which are representative of the variability observed in a 5-year set of meteorological and hydrobiological data (1984-1988). An increase in the solar radiation is found to reduce the gross primary production, while an increase in the initial nitrate quantity or the wind intensity leads to a higher gross primary production, and the reverse. In the case of variations of the solar radiation (+/- 2%), the simulations give an annual gross primary production integrated over 200 m included between 44.8 and 46.7 g C m(-2) year(-1), representing a variability of 4%. With the variations of the surface wind intensity (+/-10%), the runs carry to an annual gross primary production integrated over 200 m from 34.1 to 59.1 g C m(-2) year(-1), representing a variability of 54%. The variations of the initial nitrate concentration (+/- 50%) lead to an annual gross primary production integrated over 200 m between 20.7 and 69.8 g C m(-2) year(-1) which represents a variability of 108%. An analysis of the relationship between the total gross primary production and the annual mean depth of the mixed layer has shown that the deeper the mixed layer is, the higher is the total annual gross primary production.

The integration of BIM and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has potential to reduce the time for life cycle inventory, and at the same time, substantially improve the representativeness of the LCA results for the specific building design. The latter merit is not trivial. For instance, due to time limit, most building LCA studies estimate the building materials and fuels consumed in construction phase quite roughly, which excludes the choices on a wide range of construction techniques, materials, specialties and machines, no need to mention the energy consumption in operation phase, which is usually estimated in an even bolder manner. The roughness of the LCA practice undermines its credibility and hinders its application as a decision supporting tool for low carbon design. Currently, China's Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector is undergoing a smart transformation, steered by the increased use of BIM. This paper presents a BIM-enabled LCA method and illustrates how the method can be used to facilitate the low carbon design under the circumstance of the smart AEC transition in China. A case study on carbon footprint accounting for a residential building is conducted. In this study, various software tools and data sources are combined to enhance the data flow and interoperability between BIM models and LCA models. BIM tools are used to create the BIM model, calculate the inputs (materials, construction machines, energies, water and so on) of on-site construction process and simulate the energy consumption of building operation. The eBalance, a China's local LCA software tool is applied to build the LCA model. The Chinese Life Cycle Database is used as the main data source (72.73%) to calculate the carbon footprint of the given building while the Ecoinvent database and European Life Cycle Database act as supplementary. The results show that the carbon footprint of the building is 2993 kg CO(2)eq/m(2). The operation phase contributes to 69% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, while the building material production contributes to 24%. Concrete is the most used building material, which accounts for 82% of mass but contributes to only 44% of the material related GHG emission. Although steel and aluminum account for only 2.6% and 1.4% of mass, they contribute to 28% and 17% GHG emission, respectively. Through BIM-enable LCA modeling, the potential life cycle environmental performance of the buildings can be assessed in detail. This makes the LCA not only more accessible but also more credible for the AEC professionals to use it as a guide for the low carbon design of buildings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Kuhdasht plain located in Iran is one of such settlements in which human activities have led to irreversible destruction of groundwater resources during the last two decades. A case study is performed to properly investigate the causes of groundwater resources degradation in Kuhdasht plain and optimize measures for the sustainable groundwater resources management by the DPSIR approach. The results showed that the key driving forces influencing groundwater resources have been the population growth, the increased cultivated surface area, the cropping pattern change, the changes in industrial water consumption pattern and per capita water consumption, the natural resources destruction, and climate variability. The main pressures on groundwater resources of the study region have been extensive groundwater overdraft, decreased aquifer recharge caused by reduced precipitation, vegetation cover destruction, and land use change. Based on the results, the aquifer exhibits a negative balance for 1989-2008 period as well as a 7-m decline in the aquifer's water table, and land subsidence of 0.012-0.31 m. On the other hand, the results indicate that despite the agricultural sector has exerted the highest stress on the Kuhdasht aquifer, this sector has had the lowest economic efficiency with little contribution to employment creation.\",\"[Borji, M.; Nia, A.

Objective: To evaluate the impact of an enriched medical home intervention using community health workers on improving immunization adherence among young children. Design: The intervention group received home visits from trained community health workers to support families in adhering to recommended care while the comparison group received usual care (i.e. no home visits/reminders). Immunization history and socio-demographic data were collected using medical records and a validated questionnaire. The doubly robust estimation of risk difference, which combines weighting via propensity score and outcome regression model, was used to compare immunization adherence rates between two groups. Setting: Primary care practices affiliated with a suburban tertiary care academic medical center serving a socioeconomically diverse population. Participants: The study sample included children <= 2 years of age at enrollment who crossed at least one age time point of 3, 7, 15, or 24 months during their 6 months post-enrollment period. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was age-specific immunization up-to-date status defined by CDC guidelines. The primary predictor was participation in the intervention. Results: The analysis included 201 children in the usual care group and 110 children in the intervention group. The usual care and intervention groups were divided into subgroups of newborn and infant/toddler to account for prior immunization history. After adjusting for differences in group characteristics, we found a significant absolute increase in the up-to-date immunization likelihood for both newborns (20.9%, p = 0.01) and infants/toddlers (16.8%, p = 0.01) receiving the intervention when compared to their peers receiving usual clinical care. Conclusions and relevance: Our findings demonstrate the positive impact of an enriched medical home intervention using community health worker home visitation on early childhood immunization up-to-date status. With further study, this model may provide a cost-effective approach to improving childhood vaccination rates, especially for vulnerable groups. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study evaluated SWEs in rural Rwanda, where nine health care facilities (HCF) owned and operated water kiosks supplying water from onsite water treatment systems (WTS). SWEs were monitored for 12 months. Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (rs) was used to evaluate correlations between demand for kiosk water and community characteristics, and between kiosk profit and factors influencing the cost model. On average, SWEs distributed 15,300 L/month. One SWE ran at a loss, four had profit margins of <= 10% and four had profit margins of 45-75%. Factors influencing SWE performance were intermittent water supply (87% of SWE closures were due to water shortage), consumer demand (demand was high where populations already used improved water sources (r(s) = 0.81, p = 0.02)), price sensitivity (demand was lower where SWEs had high prices (r(s) = -0.65, p = 0.08)), and production cost (water utility tariffs negatively impacted SWE profits (r(s) = -0.52, p < 0.01)). Sustainability was more favorable in circumstances where recovery of capital expenditures was not expected, and the demand for treated water was sufficient to fund operational expenditures. Future research is needed to assess the extent to which kiosk revenue can support ongoing operational costs of WTS and kiosks both at HCF and in other contexts.\",\"[Huttinger, Alexandra; Brunson, Laura; Moe, Christine L.; Roha, Kristin] Emory Univ, Ctr Global Safe Water Sanitat & Hyg, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Ngirimpuhwe, Providence; Mfura, Leodomir; Kayigamba, Felix] Access Project Rwanda, Kigali, Nyarugenge Dist, Rwanda; [Ciza, Philbert] Republ Rwanda Minist Hlth Environm Hlth Desk, Kigali, Kicukiro Distri, Rwanda; [Dreibelbis, Robert] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Civil Engn & Environm Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Brunson, Laura] Millennium Water Alliance, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Dreibelbis, Robert] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1E 7HT, England\",\"Huttinger, A (reprint author), Emory Univ, Ctr Global Safe Water Sanitat & Hyg, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.\",ahuttin@emory.edu; lbrunson7@gmail.com; clmoe@emory.edu; kmroha@gmail.com; ramond2020@gmail.com; leodomir2003@gmail.com; fkaigamba@gmail.com; cizaphilbert@gmail.com; Robert.Dreibelbis@lshtm.ac.uk,,\"Dreibelbis, Robert/0000-0002-9716-0419\",General Electric Foundation,\"We offer sincere thanks to the staff of the participating health centers for their extensive collaboration and dedication and to the study participants for their cooperation and time.

The management of highway pavement has been traditionally focused on economy. In this study, the impacts of management decisions are examined in three dimensions, including life-cycle cost (LCC), energy consumption, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Quantitative models to predict the three dimensions are developed from mechanistic-empirical pavement analysis results. Two decision variables, pavement thickness and threshold roughness level for pavement resurfacing, are found to be significant in affecting the three dimensions. These two variables are subsequently used as decision variables in multiobjective optimization. The ranges of decisions that result in minimum LCC, energy consumption, and GHG emissions are identified through multiobjective optimization.

Specifically for top marine predators, differences in movements and behavior may result from responses to variation in a patchy, dynamic environment, Satellite-linked time-depth recorders (SLTDRs) were used to examine differences in narwhal Monodon monoceros diving behavior and habitat selection among 3 sub-populations in Canada and West Greenland (n = 16 individuals). The number of dives to different depths and time allocation within the water column was investigated in 3 seasons, with a focus on 2 discrete wintering grounds in Baffin Bay. Diving parameters were calculated from binned dive data and analyzed using repeated-measures mixed models accounting for temporal autocorrelation and individual variability. The number of surface dives (0 to 50 m) and time at the surface declined between summer and winter. Clear differences were observed between 2 wintering grounds. Whales occupying one wintering ground spent most of their time diving to between 200 and 400 m (25 dives per day, SE 3), confirmed by both depth and temperature recording tags. In contrast, narwhals in a separate wintering ground spent less time at shallow depths and most of their time diving to at least 800 m (13 to 26 dives per day, SE 1 to 3). A model of occupancy time at depth showed that whales making multiple daily deep dives spent over 3 h at >800 m (SD 0.6) and traveled 13 min (SD 1) per round trip to reach this depth, Whales diving to between 200 and 400 m spent approximately 2.5 h (SD 0.4) at this depth, traveling 5 min per round trip.

Over time, the increasing amount of potentially harmful matter and energy, of mainly anthropic origin or influence, that reaches the interior of a shallow karst cavity can modify the hypogeal ecosystem and increase the risk of damage to the Palaeolithic rock art often preserved within the cavity. This study proposes a new Protected Area status based on the geological processes that control these matter and energy fluxes into the Altamira cave karst system. Analysis of the geological characteristics of the shallow karst system shows that direct and lateral infiltration, internal water circulation, ventilation, gas exchange and transmission of vibrations are the processes that control these matter and energy fluxes into the cave. This study applies a comprehensive methodological approach based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to establish the area of influence of each transfer process. The stratigraphic and structural characteristics of the interior of the cave were determined using 3D Laser Scanning topography combined with classical field work, data gathering, cartography and a porosity-permeability analysis of host rock samples. As a result, it was possible to determine the hydrogeological behavior of the cave. In addition, by mapping and modeling the surface parameters it was possible to identify the main features restricting hydrological behavior and hence direct and lateral infiltration into the cave. These surface parameters included the shape of the drainage network and a geomorphological and structural characterization via digital terrain models. Geological and geomorphological maps and models integrated into the GIS environment defined the areas involved in gas exchange and ventilation processes. Likewise, areas that could potentially transmit vibrations directly into the cave were identified. This study shows that it is possible to define a Protected Area by quantifying the area of influence related to each transfer process. The combined maximum area of influence of all the processes will result in the new Protected Area. This area will thus encompass all the processes that account for most of the matter and energy carried into the cave and will fulfill the criteria used to define the Protected Area. This methodology is based on the spatial quantification of processes and entities of geological origin and can therefore be applied to any shallow karst system that requires protection.

Using a computer simulation of the SD model, the variation trends from 2006 to 2030 in population, economy, water supply and demand, and pressure on the water environment were derived for Beijing, from which 12 core variables of the model were chosen as the WRCC evaluation indices. Five cases were designed in this study. The results indicate that the WRCC will continue to decline annually by following the status quo (Case 1), since the water environment will have difficulty in supporting the long-term social and economic development of Beijing. The status quo of Beijing's socioeconomic development is therefore not sustainable. In order to address this problem, five optimization cases we're put forward to improve the WRCC, and the carrying capacities and trends of the cases were compared and analyzed. Under Case 5, the WRCC (0.8 in 2030) will increase by 50%, compared to that in Case 1 (0.4 in 2030), while the water supply and demand ratio will be 20% higher than the average, and the water pollution will be 35% lower than the average in 2030. According to the analysis results, in order to guarantee sustainable utilization of water resources and social economy development in Beijing, it is necessary to increase water saving policies and pollution control investment in the future. Corresponding measures will need to be taken to ensure the implementation of water saving strategies to improve the water environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigates how systematically the identification of marginal suppliers can be performed across different products, while maintaining consistent modeling choices. Some products relevant for the Belgian construction sector are taken as a case study. To gain insight in the current practice of identifying marginal suppliers, 30 recent studies have been reviewed. Based on the findings of the review, a method was proposed to identify geographical market boundaries from trade data and sensitive suppliers from production data. Both retrospective and prospective approaches to anticipate the future effect of a change in demand were taken into account. The method was applied to compute both a retrospective and a prospective marginal supplier's mix per product. Finally, the effect of the modeling choices on the size of geographical market boundaries and marginal mixes was estimated via regression analysis. The forecasts and marginal mixes obtained matched with those from the existing literature, although clear differences in results are observed between the retrospective and prospective approach. Deviations from default assumptions in LCA were observed as well, such as large regional geographical markets for cement and aggregates instead of local ones. The statistical sensitivity analysis showed that identifying geographical market boundaries has the largest effect on the final marginal mix and that these markets are relative stable over time. The proposed method and corresponding sensitivity analysis is an attempt to gain insight into the effect of modeling choices in the context of the identification of marginal suppliers for consequential LCA. It can in principle be applied to any product for which trade and production data are available. The proposed method helps to identify marginal mixes on a consistent and transparent way, to improve the robustness of the results in future consequential LCAs.\",\"[Buyle, Matthias; Audenaert, Amaryllis] Univ Antwerp, Appl Engn, EMIB, Groenenborgerlaan 171, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Pizzol, Massimo] Aalborg Univ, Dept Planning, Rendsburggade 14, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark; [Audenaert, Amaryllis] Univ Antwerp, Appl Econ, Dept Engn Management, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium\",\"Buyle, M (reprint author), Univ Antwerp, Appl Engn, EMIB, Groenenborgerlaan 171, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium.\",matthias.buyle@uantwerpen.be,,,Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) [V407616N],Thanks to Erik Fransen for providing insightful and useful comments on the statistical analysis.

Anthropogenic pressure seriously threatens health and long-term sustainability of marine environments. For these reasons, integrated approaches capable of combining ecological and socio-economic aspects are needed to achieve nature conservation and sustainability targets. In this study, the value of natural capital of the Egadi Islands Marine Protected Area (EI-MPA) was assessed through a biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model. The emergy value of both autotrophic and heterotrophic natural capital stocks was calculated for the main habitats of the EI-MPA. Eventually, the emergy value of natural capital was converted into monetary units to better communicate its importance to local managers and policy-makers. The total value of natural capital in the EI-MPA resulted in 1.12.10(21) sej, equivalent to about 1.17 billion of euros. In addition, using Marxan software, the results of the environmental accounting were integrated with spatial data on main human uses. This integration took into account the trade-offs between conservation measures and human exploitation by means of two different scenarios, with and without considering human uses in the EIMPA. The comparison between the scenarios highlighted the importance of taking into account human activities in marine spatial planning (MSP), allowing the identification of key areas for natural capital conservation. In conclusion, this study showed the importance of integrating environmental accounting with conservation planning to support effective strategies for ecological protection and sustainable management of human activities. The results of this study represent a first benchmark useful to explore alternative nature conservation strategies in the EI-MPA, and, more in general, in Mediterranean MPAs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We used a framework to present the effect of the two fundamental social, political and economic changes on the biodiversity and ecosystems of Hungary from 1989 until recently. First, following the democratic transformation in 1989 social, political, economic and institutional drivers led to the increase in farmland biodiversity, improvement of water quality due to less chemical use and decrease of habitat loss within protected areas. At the same time, land privatisation and uncertain ownership led to habitat degradation, abandonment and fragmentation. These changes were coupled with the spread of alien species and re-ploughing. The second change was joining the European Union in 2004. This resulted in the establishment of the Natura 2000 network, the application of the relevant EU policies, and access to conservation related EU funds, which contributed to successful habitat restorations increasing of some charismatic species' populations. Meanwhile, however, disappearance of extensive farming practices, agricultural intensification and infrastructural developments driven by some increasing EU funds led to a net habitat loss, degradation and decline in biodiversity, with more than half of the species of European importance having unfavourable conservation status. Increased support for conservation institutions, adaptive and extended agri-environment schemes and further research and monitoring to establish, refine and supervise sustainable management practices, including water management, are needed to prevent further biodiversity loss in the coming years.\",\"[Mihok, Barbara; Biro, Marianna; Molnar, Zsolt; Boloni, Janos; Baldi, Andras] MTA Ctr Ecol Res, Lendulet Ecosyst Serv Res Grp, Inst Ecol & Bot, Alkotmany U 2-4, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary; [Kovacs, Eszter] MTA Ctr Ecol Res, GINOP Sustainable Ecosyst Grp, Klebelsberg Kuno 3, H-8237 Tihany, Hungary; [Eros, Tibor] Balaton Limnol Inst, MTA Ctr Ecol Res, Klebelsberg K 3, H-8237 Tihany, Hungary; [Standovar, Tibor] Eotvos Lord Univ, Dept Plant Systemat, Ecol & Theoret Biol, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Torok, Peter] MTADE Biodiversiry & Ecosyst Serv Res Grp, Egyet Sqr 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Csorba, Gabor] Hungarian Nat Hist Museum, Dept Zool, U Baross 13, H-1088 Budapest, Hungary; [Margoczi, Katalin] Univ Szeged, Dept Ecol, H-6726 Szeged, Hungary\",\"Mihok, B (reprint author), MTA Ctr Ecol Res, Lendulet Ecosyst Serv Res Grp, Inst Ecol & Bot, Alkotmany U 2-4, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary.\",mihok.barbara@okologia.mta.hu,\"Torok, Peter/C-5514-2008\",\"Torok, Peter/0000-0002-4428-3327; Kovacs, Eszter/0000-0001-8509-6432\",\"Lend-diet Program of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences [LP2011-014/2015]; Research Centre of Excellence [1476-4/2016/FEKUT]; NKFIH [K 119225]; project \"\"Sustainable Conservation on Hungarian Natura 2000 Sites'' [SH/4/8];  [GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00019]\",\"Barbara Mihok and Andras Baldi were funded by the Lend-diet Program of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (LP2011-014/2015) and by GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00019 together with Marianna Biro, Zsolt Molnar, Janos Boloni, Tibor Eros.

To provide consistency amongst these separate impact pathways, general principles for their modelling are provided in this paper. These are refinements to the principles that have already been proposed in publications by the UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative. In particular, this paper addresses the calculation of land use interventions and land use impacts, the issue of impact reversibility, the spatial and temporal distribution of such impacts and the assessment of absolute or relative ecosystem quality changes. Based on this, we propose a guideline to build methods for land use impact assessment in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Recommendations are given for the development of new characterization models and for which a series of key elements should explicitly be stated, such as the modelled land use impact pathways, the land use/cover typology covered, the level of biogeographical differentiation used for the characterization factors, the reference land use situation used and if relative or absolute quality changes are used to calculate land use impacts. Moreover, for an application of the characterisation factors (CFs) in an LCA study, data collection should be transparent with respect to the data input required from the land use inventory and the regeneration times. Indications on how generic CFs can be used for the background system as well as how spatial-based CFs can be calculated for the foreground system in a specific LCA study and how land use change is to be allocated should be detailed. Finally, it becomes necessary to justify the modelling period for which land use impacts of land transformation and occupation are calculated and how uncertainty is accounted for. The presented guideline is based on a number of assumptions: Discrete land use types are sufficient for an assessment of land use impacts; ecosystem quality remains constant over time of occupation; time and area of occupation are substitutable; transformation time is negligible; regeneration is linear and independent from land use history and landscape configuration; biodiversity and multiple ecosystem services are independent; the ecological impact is linearly increasing with the intervention; and there is no interaction between land use and other drivers such as climate change. These assumptions might influence the results of land use Life Cycle Impact Assessment and need to be critically reflected. In this and the other papers of the special issue, we presented the principles and recommendations for the calculation of land use impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services on a global scale. In the framework of LCA, they are mainly used for the assessment of land use impacts in the background system. The main areas for further development are the link to regional ecological models running in the foreground system, relative weighting of the ecosystem services midpoints and indirect land use.\",\"[Koellner, Thomas; Souza, Danielle Maia] Univ Bayreuth, Fac Biol Chem & Geosci, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [de Baan, Laura] ETH, Inst Environm Decis, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Beck, Tabea] Univ Stuttgart, Dept Life Cycle Engn, D-70771 Leinfelden Echterdingen, Germany; [Brandao, Miguel; Souza, Danielle Maia] Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Sustainabil Assessment Unit, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21027 Ispra, Varese, Italy; [Civit, Barbara] Univ Tecnol Nacl, CONICET, Fac Reg Mendoza, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina; [Margni, Manuele; Saad, Rosie] Ecole Polytech, Dept Genie Chim, CIRAIG, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada; [Mila i Canals, Llorenc] Unilever R&D, Safety & Environm Assurance Ctr, Sharnbrook MK44 1LQ, Beds, England; [Mueller-Wenk, Ruedi] Univ St Gallen, Inst Econ & Environm, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland\",\"Koellner, T (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, Fac Biol Chem & Geosci, GEO 2,Room 1-17,Univ Str 30, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.\",thomas.koellner@uni-bayreuth.de,\"Brandao, Miguel/H-3903-2013; Koellner, Thomas/B-8286-2008\",\"Brandao, Miguel/0000-0002-8101-8928; Koellner, Thomas/0000-0001-5022-027X; /0000-0002-5370-3928\",UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative,\"The authors wish to thank the UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative for financial support of this work under the project Operational Characterization Factors for Land Use Impacts on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in the Life Cycle Impact Assessment-Compatible with the Framework of the UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative (LULCIA).

Site selection immensely determines the life cycle of LCRPS projects based on sustainability perspective, in need of considering the impact on environment and society. However, inadequacies still exist in the decision for LCRPS site selection. Firstly, uncertainties of information cannot be described integrally. Secondly, consideration of the correlation among criteria from sustainability perspective is lacking. Thirdly, the ranking methods in previous studies cannot reflect decision makers' subjective preferences. Therefore, this study establishes a decision framework for LCRPS site selection utilizing Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (Fuzzy ANP) method and Fuzzy Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija IKompromisno Resenje (Fuzzy VIKOR) method. First, the triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TIFNs) are adopted to describe indeterminate information. Second, fuzzy ANP is introduced to reflect the correlation among criteria based on sustainability perspective. Third, fuzzy VIKOR is employed to rank the options on the basis of decision makers' subjective preferences. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a case study of Guangdong province with sensitive analysis and comparative analysis is conducted. The result shows the LCRPS site located in Dongguan should be selected as the optimal site.\",\"[Wu, Yunna; Zhang, Buyuan; Xu, Chuanbo; Li, Lingwenying] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yunna; Zhang, Buyuan; Xu, Chuanbo; Li, Lingwenying] North China Elect Power Univ, Beijing Key Lab New Energy & Low Carbon Dev, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China\",\"Zhang, BY (reprint author), North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.\",ncepuwuyunna@126.com; 13269072433@163.com; 18810736266@163.com; llwy_1001@126.com,,,Special Project of Cultivation and Development of Innovation Base [Z171100002217024]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2018ZD14],This paper is supported by the 2017 Special Project of Cultivation and Development of Innovation Base (NO.

The model involves diverse stakeholders, including ethnic-based community health equity coalitions, the local public health department, hospitals and health systems, a health sciences university, a school district, the faith community, and others sectors. Community Context We report on 3 SFHIP prevention initiatives: reducing consumption of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs), regulating retail alcohol sales, and eliminating disparities in children's oral health. Methods SFHIP is governed by a steering committee. Partnership working groups for each initiative collaborate to 1) develop and implement action plans emphasizing feasible, scalable, translational-science-informed interventions and 2) consider sustainability early in the planning process by including policy and structural interventions. Outcome Through SFHIP's efforts, San Francisco enacted ordinances regulating sale and advertising of SSBs and a ballot measure establishing a soda tax. Most San Francisco hospitals implemented or committed to implementing healthy-beverage policies that prohibited serving or selling SSBs. SFHIP helped prevent Starbucks and Taco Bell from receiving alcohol licenses in San Francisco and helped prevent state authorization of sale of powdered alcohol. SFHIP increased the number of primary care clinics providing fluoride varnish at routine well-child visits from 3 to 14 and acquired a state waiver to allow dental clinics to be paid for dental services delivered in schools. Interpretation The SFHIP model of collective impact emphasizing community engagement and policy change accomplished many of its intermediate goals to create an environment promoting health and health equity.\",\"[Grumbach, Kevin; Vargas, Roberto A.; Fleisher, Paula; Chung, Lisa; Liu, Wylie; Schmidt, Laura A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Clin & Translat Sci Inst, Commun Engagement & Hlth Policy Program, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Grumbach, Kevin; Vargas, Roberto A.; Fleisher, Paula] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Family & Community Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Aragon, Tomas J.; Chawla, Colleen; Jones, Paula] San Francisco Dept Publ Hlth, San Francisco, CA USA; [Chung, Lisa] Univ Calif San Francisco, Sch Dent, Div Oral Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, San Francisco, CA USA; [Yant, Abbie] St Francis Mem Hosp, Dign Hlth, San Francisco, CA USA; [Garcia, Estela R.] Inst Familiar Raza Inc, San Francisco, CA USA; [Garcia, Estela R.] Chicano Latino Indigena Hlth Equity Coalit, San Francisco, CA USA; [Santiago, Amor] APA Family Support Serv, San Francisco, CA USA; [Santiago, Amor] API Hlth Parity Council, San Francisco, CA USA; [Lang, Perry L.] Rafiki Wellness, San Francisco, CA USA; [Lang, Perry L.] African Amer Community Hlth Equ Council, San Francisco, CA USA; [Schmidt, Laura A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Philip R Lee Inst Hlth Policy Studies, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA\",\"Grumbach, K (reprint author), Zuckerberg San Francisco Gen Hosp, Dept Family & Community Med, Family & Community Med, Ward 83,Room 310,1001 Potrero Ave, San Francisco, CA 94110 USA.\",kevin.grumbach@ucsf.edu,,\"Aragon, Tomas/0000-0002-2058-0423\",Metta Fund; Hellman Foundation; San Francisco Foundation; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences; National Institutes of Health (NIH) through UCSF-CTSI [UL1 TR000004],\"We thank the SFHIP Steering Committee, backbone staff, and Partnership Working Groups.

This study outlines a management framework based on an analysis of a case study dataset of long-term coastal change in southwestern Taiwan. Specifically, the coastal structure of Taiwan's largest lagoon, Cigu, was analyzed over a 300-year-long period. A series of satellite-derived images between 1974 and 2015 were assessed. The dataset was integrated with a geographic information system (GIS). The results revealed that human activities, including the construction of hard structures along the coastline and along an upstream reservoir, altered the balance of sediment transmission and resulted in the retreat and erosion of barrier sandbars along the coast. A lagoon evolution model revealed that the Cigu Lagoon may disappear in the future. Furthermore, the coastline will continue to retreat because harbor dykes and offshore breakwaters stop sediment transportation to the downdrift. Soft erosion mitigation is suggested as an immediate approach. However, recovering the sediment budget from reservoirs and dykes could be a long-term solution. In principle, the best.coastal environmental protection plan from the national involves delaying urbanization and preserving unexploited coastal wetlands.\",\"[Chang, Yi; Chu, Ka-wai; Chuang, Laurence Zsu-Hsin] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Ocean Technol & Marine Affairs, Tainan, Taiwan\",\"Chang, Y (reprint author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Ocean Technol & Marine Affairs, Tainan, Taiwan.\",yichang@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,,,,,51.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,7.0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,\"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS\",0169-2046,1872-6062,,LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN,Landsc.

This study considers the domestic waste generated by households and waste generated commercially. Six municipal solid waste (MSW) scenarios (SR1, SR2, aEuro broken vertical bar, SR6) are evaluated using a triple bottom line (TBL) approach that incorporates environmental, financial, and social bottom lines (social BLs). Within the TBL framework, the environmental BL employs LCA in accordance with ISO 14044. The financial BL is calculated using capital and operational costs as well as the associated recycling revenues. The social BL applies macro-economic indicators that examine the effects of a given MSW scenario (SR) on the inhabitants. To integrate the TBLs, we apply an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) because of its advantage of pairwise unit-free rescaling. The relative importance of each BL is determined by considering the political, legal, socio-cultural, and economic climates of the country. The relative weights are cross-multiplied with indicators from each BL to calculate a composite sustainability index (CSI) for the proposed MSW SR. The environmental BL (LCA) indicates that global warming, acidification, and human toxicity are the most adversely affected impact categories, considering the local conditions and waste composition. Environmentally, SR1 (landfilling) scored the worst in almost all impact categories and, thus, was labeled the worst-case scenario environmentally. SR6 (composting, recycling, and incineration) performed the best from an environmental perspective. Financially, landfilling (SR1) is the most economical scenario. Any SR that focused on incineration (SR2 and SR5) was financially unfavorable. The scenarios that involved composting were scored as financially reasonable (SR3, SR4, and SR6). From a social acceptability perspective, SR2 (incineration) scored the highest, while SR1 (landfills) scored the lowest. Finally, across the TBL framework, SR4 (composting and incineration) had the highest CSI based on the relative importance scheme adopted for each BL. Although they are often overlooked in most LCA studies, the financial and social aspects are indispensable to proving feasibility and credibility at a strategic level. The complexity of financial and social formulations in LCA is inherited from the difficulty in quantifying emissions and other impacts. In addition, from a social perspective, the contingent risks and associated uncertainty vary widely across cultures, ideologies, and degrees of development and are further complicated because of the scarcity and uncertainty of the data.\",\"[Aleisa, Esra] Kuwait Univ, Coll Engn & Petr, Ind & Management Syst Engn Dept, Khaldia Bldg 8KH,3rd Floor,POB 5969, Safat 13060, Kuwait; [Al-Jarallah, Rawa] Kuwait Univ, Coll Engn & Petr, Dept Civil Engn, Khaldia Bldg 14KH,2nd Floor,POB 5969, Safat 13060, Kuwait\",\"Aleisa, E (reprint author), Kuwait Univ, Coll Engn & Petr, Ind & Management Syst Engn Dept, Khaldia Bldg 8KH,3rd Floor,POB 5969, Safat 13060, Kuwait.\",e.aleisa@ku.edu.kw,,,Research Administration at Kuwait University [EV03/10],The research team thanks the Research Administration at Kuwait University for funding this project under grant number EV03/10 and for their language editorial effort.

When DSM is accomplished in an object oriented programming framework, modelling is highly interactive. The Field Phosphorus Model (FPM) was created with STELLA(R) II, an object oriented DSM programming environment. FPM is based on sophisticated accounting of all annual inputs and outputs of phosphorus for a farm field and simulates, on a yearly basis, patterns of phosphorus export from farm fields used for manure management on dairy farms. Model inputs include atmospheric deposition, manure application and chemical fertilizer; outputs include surface runoff, crop harvest, and movement into deeper soil layers. Using two BMP scenarios, the implications for long-term phosphorus export levels from the field to surface and ground waters are discussed. Changes in the land treatment or BMP levels on the field results in a lag time between when the BMP is implemented and when the full impact on phosphorus export is seen. The Field Phosphorus Model suggests that the simultaneous reduction of long-term phosphorus output to surface and ground waters is accomplished by implementation of BMPs that limit the input of phosphorus to the field.\",\"UNIV CONNECTICUT,DEPT NAT RESOURCES MANAGEMENT & ENGN,STORRS,CT 06269\",\"CASSELL, EA (reprint author), UNIV VERMONT,SCH NAT RESOURCES,BURLINGTON,VT 05405, USA.\",,,,,,,13.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,\"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\",0273-1223,,,WATER SCI TECHNOL,Water Sci.

Cities now have access to an increasingly wide range of transport policy measures which continue to expand. However, the health impacts of these measures are not always explicitly defined or well understood and therefore may not be sufficiently considered when selecting policy measures. Aims: The aim of this paper is to qualitatively review 64 different transport policy measures indexed in the Knowledgebase on Sustainable Urban Land use and Transport (KonSULT), and provide an indication of their potential health impacts, based on expert judgment. Results: We report that key health impacts of transport occur via pathways of motor vehicle crashes, traffic-related air pollution, noise, heat islands, lack of green space, physical inactivity, climate change and social exclusion and community severance. We systematically describe the expected health impacts of transport policy measures sourced from KonSULT and fmd that many, but not all, can have a positive impact on health. The magnitude of both the positive and negative impacts remains largely unknown and warrants further research and synthesis. Conclusions: Uiban transport is responsible for a large mortality and morbidity burden and policy measures that are beneficial to health need to be implemented to reduce this burden. There are considerable differences between these policy measures in terms of potential health impacts and this should be considered in any transport planning. It is important to monitor the health impacts of all policy measures to provide further evidence on whether they work as expected or not, to ensure that the most cost-effective solutions, with the largest benefits and the smallest health risks, are being adopted.\",\"[Khreis, Haneen; May, Anthony D.] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Khreis, Haneen; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark J.] Ctr Res Environm Epidemiol CREAL, ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain; [Khreis, Haneen; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark J.] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Khreis, Haneen; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark J.] CIBER Epidemiol & Salud Publ CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain\",\"Khreis, H (reprint author), Ctr Res Environm Epidemiol CREAL, ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain.\",ts12hrk@leeds.ac.uk,,\"Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark/0000-0001-9461-7981\",,,,129.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,\"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND\",2214-1405,,,J TRANSP HEALTH,J.

They encompass the social, economic and environmental dimensions and search for solutions that are able not only to monitor but also to control the operational indicators attributed to each objective. It is expected that many of these indicators are associated to each other and the accurate understanding of these correlations allows to build predictive statistical models that can improve the monitoring and controlling of variables. It would increase the rate of success in achieving the SDG. This study tested a linear multivariate model able to predict the human development index based on environmental variables which are related to SDG 3 (health), 4 (education), 8 (sustainable economic growth and decent work) and 15 (protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems). We fitted the models using the Linear Discriminant Analysis and Best Subset Selection applied to a Linear Multivariate Regression. The model predictive ability was assessed by R-2 and cross-validation (CV). The results showed that exposure to unsafe sanitation, access to drinking water, tree cover loss, unsafe water quality, wastewater treatment level, and household air pollution are excellent predictors of human development index of a population, with R-2 = 0.94 and 10-fold CV Mean Squared Error equal to 0.0014.

There is a growing need to understand community-level drivers of sanitation use, as poor sanitation in a few households can create risks for neighboring households and contaminate the surrounding environment. This paper considers sanitation in the context of common-pool resources, focusing on processes of collective action and sustainable sanitation use, and draws on a case study conducted in Koassanga, Plateau-Central, Burkina Faso, where an ecological sanitation system intervention was implemented. Using a qualitative study design, 26 semi-structured interviews were conducted with residents using a social capital framework for water, sanitation and hygiene. Data were thematically analyzed to understand how collective action played a role in sustaining use of the sanitation system. The case study findings indicated that social capital characterized by membership in local groups and associations may have contributed to successful implementation of the intervention and ending open defecation, through normalization and monitoring of the use of ecological sanitation systems. In addition, community leaders played prominent roles in ensuring that collective management of the sanitation systems was sustained. These findings highlight potential for further examination of sanitation systems from a common pool resources perspective to identify other factors that contribute to long-term sustain ability. With growing interest in community-led sanitation approaches, this understanding can inform more effective strategies for governments and NGOs to promote the health of entire communities to achieve SDG targets for universal coverage.\",\"[Dickin, Sarah] Stockholm Environm Inst, Linnegatan 87D, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Bisung, Elijah] Queens Univ, Sch Kinesiol & Hlth Studies, SKHS Bldg 28,Div StreetQueens Univ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Savadogo, Karim] Cabinet Etud Format Amenagement Ecol CEFAME, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso\",\"Dickin, S (reprint author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Linnegatan 87D, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden.\",sarah.dickin@sei-international.org; eb120@queensu.ca; ksavadogo@yahoo.fr,,\"Dickin, Sarah/0000-0003-0437-3755\",\"Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, SEI Initiatives on behavior and choice and sustainable sanitation\",We would like to thank interview participants and key informants for their contribution to this study.

The Photovoltaics Manufacturing Consortium (PVMC) is leading research and development of CIGS in New York State. This study presents the results of a life cycle assessment (LCA) study of CIGS technology, currently being advanced by PVMC, and compares the environmental performance of several emerging alternative materials and processes. The results provide manufacturers with an understanding of how to produce CIGS sustainably. The cradle-to-gate LCA study followed the International Standards Organization (ISO) 14040 series. In addition to analyzing CIGS cells, the study evaluated zinc oxysulfide (Zn(O,S)) as an alternative for cadmium sulfide (CdS) for the junction partner, and an integrated cell interconnect (ICI) system as an alternative for the screen printing and stringer. Life cycle inventory data for the CIGS cell and alternatives were obtained from PVMC for the product manufacturing stage. Global Solar Energy, Inc. (GSE), a PVMC member and CIGS manufacturer, provided data for the ICI alternative. This data was supplemented by secondary data, from thinkstep, and modeled in GaBi6. The end-of-life stage was not modeled due to limited inventory data. The results identified the following key drivers of environmental and toxicity impacts from the manufacture of CIGS photovoltaic cells: (i) silver used in the stringer and screen printing processes, (ii) metals comprising the CIGS layer, (iii) surface washing of the stainless steel substrate, and (iv) copper in the cable for the balance of system. In addition, the study found that the zinc oxysulfide alternative had lower overall impacts compared to cadmium sulfide. Substitution of the ICI system also reduced impacts of the CIGS system, by decreasing the silver needed. Finally, comparison of the overall life cycle impact results to similar systems in literature, which focused primarily on greenhouse gas emissions, found that the CIGS system fell in the lower end of the range of estimated global warming impacts. PVMC's CIGS module impacts are likely lower than those made by other manufacturers due to their use of a stainless steel versus glass substrate and reliance on a relatively clean energy mix in New York State. To further reduce impacts, PVMC may wish to substitute the ICI component for the stringer and screen printing processes, recycle additional waste materials, substitute recycled metals for virgin materials, and substitute the cadmium sulfide with the zinc oxysulfide alternative.\",\"[Amarakoon, Shanika; Vallet, Cyril] Abt Associates Inc, 55 Wheeler St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Curran, Mary Ann] BAMAC Ltd, 406 Kinsey Creek Ct, Rock Hill, SC 29730 USA; [Haldar, Pradeep; Metacarpa, David; Fobare, David; Bell, Jennifer] SUNY Polytech Inst, US Photovolta Mfg Consortium PVMC, Albany, NY 12203 USA\",\"Amarakoon, S (reprint author), Abt Associates Inc, 55 Wheeler St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.\",Shanika_Amarakoon@abtasscoc.com,,,,,,42.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,\"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY\",0948-3349,1614-7502,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

This work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to select facilities in the construction sector, which minimize environmental and energy impacts. To facilitate the understanding of the proposed methodology, a comparative LCA is performed, to determine the type of thermal insulating material in a double sheet ceramic facade and its thickness, which allows reducing the environmental impacts associated to the enclosure.

Properties of natural systems may vary significantly and in a very complex manner in space. One conceptualisation that takes into account this variability in hydraulic conductivity is based on the theory of random space functions. The effect of this randomness is that the influence of a discharge well cannot be delineated without some degree of uncertainty. This uncertainty needs to be considered when areas of contribution to wells under field conditions are to be defined. In this work, the problem is tackled by dimensional analysis and the solution is numerically treated within a stochastic approach. A steady 2-D non-uniform groundwater flow is considered in a statistically isotropic field of hydraulic conductivity K(x), with a single production well and a uniform base gradient. The analysis is performed via a Monte Carlo procedure that involves the generation of a great number of realisations of a given Y' = In(K/K-G) field, normally distributed, with zero mean, sigma(Y)(2) variance and simple exponential correlation. Various degrees of domain heterogeneity, i.e. sigma(Y)(2), are considered. The probability P-1 that an ideal solute pulse released in a given location in the aquifer reaches the well is, identified, and conceptually consistent equations of practical use for engineering purposes are proposed.\",,\"Franzetti, S (reprint author), POLITECN MILAN,DIPARIMENTO INGN IDRAUL AMBIENTALE & RILEVAMENTO,PIAZZA LEONARDO DA VINCI 32,I-20133 MILAN,ITALY.\",,,,,,,35.0,55.0,55.0,0.0,1.0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,\"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS\",0022-1694,,,J HYDROL,J.

Knowledge about the distribution and types of wetlands is in high demand by ecosystem modellers for full greenhouse gas accounting. The scope of this paper is to demonstrate the suitability of satellite radar data for the delineation of wetlands in the tundra and boreal forest biomes of central Siberia, 2. An area of more than 3 million km(2) in central Siberia was investigated using satellite data. It covers freshwater ecosystems of the tundra and non-forested peatlands in tundra and boreal forest biornes. The satellite data represent the growing seasons of 2003/2004. 3. Microwave data were acquired by the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) instrument onboard ENVISAT. The multi-temporal capabilities and resolution (150 In x 150 m in WS mode) of the ASAR wide swath mode enabled the detection of dynamic features > 2 ha over this vast area. Scatterometer (QuikScat) data could be employed to distinguish hydro-periods. 4. Wetland types have been identified on the basis of seasonal changes in backscatter. In a first step scatterometer data were used to identify the transition period from frozen to unfrozen conditions over a range of 15 degrees latitude. Inundation patterns and soil moisture changes could be identified for the different hydro-periods and used to classify wetlands. Results for peatlands have been compared with Russian forest inventory data which contain information on wetland distribution. 5. The database of permanently inundated areas is an intermediate product which enables the mapping of wetlands in two ways: (1) identification of seasonal inundation in relation to snowmelt and high permafrost tables and (2) input for density analysis of permanent small and shallow lakes in tundra areas which are important freshwater ecosystems as well as a methane source. Differences in intensity and duration of soil moisture conditions allow the identification of peatlands.

We explored what tests are done and how in public/private, rural/urban hospitals and clinics in South Africa and whether they can ensure successful POC testing. MethodsThis qualitative research study examined POC testing across major diseases in Cape Town, Durban and Eastern Cape. We conducted 101 semi-structured interviews and seven focus group discussions with doctors, nurses, community health workers, patients, laboratory technicians, policymakers, hospital managers and diagnostic manufacturers. ResultsIn South Africa, diagnostics are characterised by a centralised system. Most tests conducted on the spot can be made to work successfully as POC tests. The majority of public/private clinics and smaller hospitals send samples via couriers to centralised laboratories and retrieve results the same way, via internet, fax or phone. The main challenge to POC testing lies in transporting samples and results, while delays risk patient loss from diagnostic/treatment pathways. Strategies to deal with associated delays create new problems, such as artificially prolonged turnaround times, strains on human resources and quality of testing, compounding additional diagnostic and treatment delays. ConclusionsFor POC testing to succeed, particular characteristics of diagnostic ecosystems and adaptations of professional practices to overcome associated challenges must be taken into account. ObjectifsLa reussite des tests sur le lieu des services (LS) (realisation complete du test et du cycle de traitement lors d'une rencontre avec le patient) possede un immense potentiel de reduire les retards de diagnostic et de traitement, et d'ameliorer les resultats des patients et de la sante publique. Nous avons explore quels tests etaient effectues et comment, dans les hopitaux publics/prives, ruraux/urbains et dans les cliniques en Afrique du Sud et s'ils pouvaient effectuer des tests LS avec succes. MethodesCette etude qualitative a examine les tests LS dans les maladies majeures a Cape Town, a Durban et dans l'Eastern Cape. Nous avons mene 101 entretiens semi-structures et sept discussions focalisees de groupes avec les medecins, infirmieres, agents de sante communautaires, patients, techniciens de laboratoire, decideurs, gestionnaires d'hopitaux et fabricants de diagnostic. ResultatsEn Afrique du Sud, les diagnostics sont caracterises par un systeme centralise. La plupart des tests effectues sur place peuvent etre appliques avec succes comme tests LS. La majorite des cliniques publiques/privees et les petits hopitaux envoient des echantillons sous forme de courriers a des laboratoires centralises et recuperent les resultats de la meme maniere, via internet, fax ou telephone. Le principal defi pour les tests LS reside dans le transport des echantillons et des resultats, tandis que les retards risquent la perte du patient par les structures de diagnostic/traitement. Des strategies pour faire face aux retards associes creent de nouveaux problemes, tels qu'une duree artificiellement prolongee du processus, des contraintes sur les ressources humaines et sur la qualite des tests, ce qui aggrave les retards de diagnostic et de traitement. ConclusionsPour la reussite des tests LS, des caracteristiques particulieres des ecosystemes de diagnostic et une adaptation des pratiques professionnelles pour relever les defis associes doivent etre prises en compte. ObjetivosLas pruebas de diagnostico inmediato (POC) exitosas (completar la prueba y el ciclo de tratamiento en un solo encuentro con el paciente) tienen un potencial inmenso a la hora de reducir los retrasos en el diagnostico y el tratamiento, y mejorar los resultados para el paciente y la salud publica. Hemos explorado que pruebas se llevan a cabo y como se realizan en las clinicas y hospitales publico/privados, rural/urbanas de Sudafrica y si se podria asegurar el exito en su uso de las POCs. MetodosEste estudio cualitativo examino el diagnostico mediante POC de enfermedades graves en Ciudad del Cabo, Durban y Cabo del Este. Hemos realizado 101 entrevistas semiestructuradas y 7 discusiones de grupo focalizadas con doctores, enfermeras, trabajadores sanitarios comunitarios, pacientes, tecnicos de laboratorio, politicos, gerentes de hospital y fabricantes de pruebas diagnosticas. ResultadosEn Sudafrica los diagnosticos se caracterizan por tener un sistema centralizado. La mayoria de las pruebas realizadas en el punto de atencion al paciente podrian funcionar con exito utilizando POCs. La mayoria de las clinicas publico/privadas y hospitales mas pequenos envian muestras a traves de servicios de mensajeria a laboratorios centrales y reciben los resultados de la misma forma, a traves de internet, fax o telefono. El principal reto de las POC esta en el transporte de las muestras y el envio de los resultados, mientras que los retrasos ponen en riesgo el perder al paciente durante el diagnostico / tratamiento. Las estrategias para manejar los retrasos asociados crean nuevos problemas, tales como unos ciclos artificialmente prolongados, tension sobre los recursos humanos y la calidad de las pruebas, agravando los retrasos en el diagnostico y tratamiento. ConclusionesPara que el diagnostico mediante POC tenga exito, deben tenerse en cuenta las caracteristicas particulares de los ecosistemas de diagnostico y las adaptaciones de las practicas profesionales para poder sobreponerse a los retos asociados.\",\"[Engel, Nora; Blankvoort, Nadine] Maastricht Univ, Res Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Dept Hlth Eth & Soc, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Davids, Malika; Dheda, Keertan] Univ Cape Town, Lung Infect, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Davids, Malika; Dheda, Keertan] Univ Cape Town, Div Pulmonol, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Davids, Malika; Dheda, Keertan] Univ Cape Town, UCT Lung Inst, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Pai, Nitika Pant] McGill Univ, Div Clin Epidemiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Pai, Nitika Pant] McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Pai, Madhukar] McGill Univ, McGill Int TB Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada\",\"Engel, N (reprint author), Maastricht Univ, Res Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Dept Hlth Eth & Soc, Postbus 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.\",n.engel@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,\"Blankvoort, Nadine/0000-0003-2037-7887\",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,\"We would like to thank all study participants for their valuable time and insights.

This project developed and tested the Ophelia (OPtimising HEalth LIteracy and Access) approach for co-design of interventions to improve health literacy and equity of access. Eight principles guided this development: Outcomes focused; Equity driven, Needs diagnosis, Co-design, Driven by local wisdom, Sustainable, Responsive and Systematically applied. We report the application of the Ophelia process where proof-of-concept was defined as successful application of the principles. Methods: Nine sites were briefed on the aims of the project around health literacy, co-design and quality improvement. The sites were rural/metropolitan, small/large hospitals, community health centres or municipalities. Each site identified their own priorities for improvement; collected health literacy data using the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) within the identified priority groups; engaged staff in co-design workshops to generate ideas for improvement; developed program-logic models; and implemented their projects using Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. Evaluation included assessment of impacts on organisations, practitioners and service users, and whether the principles were applied. Results: Sites undertook co-design workshops involving discussion of service user needs informed by HLQ (n = 813) and interview data. Sites generated between 21 and 78 intervention ideas and then planned their selected interventions through program-logic models. Sites successfully implemented interventions and refined them progressively with PDSA cycles. Interventions generally involved one of four pathways: development of clinician skills and resources for health literacy, engagement of community volunteers to disseminate health promotion messages, direct impact on consumers ' health literacy, and redesign of existing services. Evidence of application of the principles was found in all sites. Conclusions: The Ophelia approach guided identification of health literacy issues at each participating site and the development and implementation of locally appropriate solutions. The eight principles provided a framework that allowed flexible application of the Ophelia approach and generation of a diverse set of interventions. Changes were observed at organisational, staff, and community member levels. The Ophelia approach can be used to generate health service improvements that enhance health outcomes and address inequity of access to healthcare.\",\"[Beauchamp, Alison; Batterham, Roy W.; Elsworth, Gerald R.; McPhee, Crystal; Osborne, Richard H.] Deakin Univ, Ctr Populat Hlth, Hlth Syst Improvement Unit, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Beauchamp, Alison; Buchbinder, Rachelle] Monash Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Dodson, Sarity] Fred Hollows Fdn, Carlton, Vic, Australia; [Astbury, Brad] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Grad Sch Educ, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Jacobson, Jeanine] Victorian Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Buchbinder, Rachelle] Cabrini Hosp, Monash Dept Clin Epidemiol, Malvern, Vic, Australia\",\"Beauchamp, A (reprint author), Deakin Univ, Ctr Populat Hlth, Hlth Syst Improvement Unit, Geelong, Vic, Australia.; Beauchamp, A (reprint author), Monash Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.\",alison.beauchamp@deakin.edu.au,,\"Osborne, Richard/0000-0002-9081-2699; Beauchamp, Alison/0000-0001-6555-6200\",Australian Research Council (ARC); Victorian Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS); Deakin University; National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Senior Research Fellowship [APP1059122]; ARC Linkage Industry Fellowship; Monash University; NHMRC Practitioner Fellowship [APP606429],\"The project was funded by a peer-reviewed nationally competitive Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Project grant, with partnership funding from the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Deakin University and Monash University.

The succession of civilizations that waxed and waned in the Mediterranean Basin over several millennia has had great impacts on biota and ecosystems everywhere in the basin. A complex 'coevolution' has been claimed to shape the interactions between ecosystem components and human societies. Two opposing schools of thought traditionally have considered the consequences of human pressures on Mediterranean ecosystems. The 'Ruined Landscape' or 'Lost Eden theory' argues that human action resulted in a cumulative degradation and desertification of Mediterranean landscapes. The second school argues that humans actually contributed to keeping Mediterranean landscapes diverse since the last glacial episode. With this debate in mind, I show the following: (1) One cannot understand the components and dynamics of current biodiversity in the Mediterranean without taking into account the history of human-induced changes; (2) The various systems of land use and resource management that provided a framework for the blossoming of Mediterranean civilizations also had profound consequences on the distribution and dynamics of species, communities, and landscapes; (3) The processes of domestication of plant and animal species, which first occurred in the eastern Mediterranean area some 10,000 years ago, contributed to the increase of certain components of biodiversity at several spatial scales. Positive and negative feedback cycles between cultural practices and natural systems at the local and regional levels have kept ecosystems robust and resilient; (4) Assuming that human action can, to a certain extent, be considered a large-scale surrogate for natural sources of ecosystem disturbance, such patterns give support to the diversity-disturbance hypothesis-specifically, intermediate levels of disturbance have promoted biological diversity; (5) Intraspecific adaptive variation increased as a result of human-induced habitat changes over millennia, resulting in bursts of differentiation during the later Holocene of local ecotypes and gene pools of domesticated and wild plant and animal species, with region-specific characters fitting them to local climate and environmental conditions. High intraspecific adaptive variation also arose from earlier natural processes of the Pleistocene, mainly from a combination of periodic refugia formation and climate dynamics. During the Holocene, the main sources of disturbance came increasingly from humans, specifically from the coupled cultural and natural modifications of community and landscape structure. It is concluded that a high degree of resilience of Mediterranean ecosystems resulted in a dynamic coexistence of human and natural living systems, which in some cases provided stability, while fostering diversity and productivity (Blondel and Aronson, 1999). The word \"\"design\"\" used in the title and elsewhere in this paper metaphorically indicates that the long-lasting influence of human impacts resulted in an unintentional shaping of individual components of landscapes.\",\"CNRS, CEFE, F-34293 Montpellier 05, France\",\"Blondel, J (reprint author), CNRS, CEFE, F-34293 Montpellier 05, France.\",jacques.blondel@cefe.cnrs.fr,,,,,\"ABBOTT RJ, 1992, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V7, P401, DOI 10.1016/0169-5347(92)90020-C; AMIGUES S, 1980, REVUE FORESTIERE FRA, V32, P211; Ammerman A.J., 1984, NEOLITHIC TRANSITION; ATTENBOROUGH D, 1987, 1 EDEN MEDITERRSANEA; Berville A.

Ecological risk assessment plays an important role in formulating environmental management strategies yet little attention to this region. In this study, we established an ecological risk assessment index system based on 30 evaluation indices in the categories of hydrometeorology, ecological environment, ground surface disturbance, and society and economy for the Gannan Plateau. An entropy method was used to calculate an index weight, and subsequently the matter-element method was used together with extension theory to establish a matter-element extension model of ecological risk. We assessed the ecological risk in this region by calculating the degree of association between index layer, system layer and target layer, and the cumulative ecological risk index. The degrees of ecological risk for the counties of the region were determined by using ArcGIS which would represent a spatial heterogeneity of the risk grade in production. Our results showed that the areas of high ecological risk were in Zhouqu County and Zhuoni County, and others were of low risk (Hezuo City, Diebu County, Xiahe County and Lintan County) or intermediate risk (Maqu County). The results of the assessment were in accord with the actual observed situation. Thus, our ecological risk assessment index system is appropriate for this region and suggests that high risk counties need a priori ecological protection. Such research could provide a technological support which would potentially prevent or reduce disasters by establishing an ecological barrier to promote the sustainable development of Gannan Plateau.\",\"[Yue, Dong-xia; Zeng, Jian-jun; Yang, Chao; Zou, Ming-liang; Li, Kai; Chen, Guan-guang; Meng, Xing-min] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Key Lab Western Chinas Environm Syst, Minist Educ, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Guo, Jian-jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Key Lab Desert & Desertificat, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xiao-feng] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Management, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China\",\"Yue, DX (reprint author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Key Lab Western Chinas Environm Syst, Minist Educ, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.\",dxyue@lzu.edu.cn; zengjj15@lzu.edu.cn; yangch2015@lzu.edu.cn; zouml15@lzu.edu.cn; lik15@lzu.edu.cn; chengg16@lzu.edu.cn; guojianjun1984@163.com; xuxf@lzu.edu.cn; xmmeng@lzu.edu.cn,,,\"Soft Science Project of Gansu province [1504ZKCA090-1]; National Natural Science Foundation of china [41671516, 41701623, 51369003]; Foundation for Excellent Youth Scholars of NIEER, CAS, National Natural Science Foundation of China [41661144046]; Special Foundation for Gansu Province International Scientific Cooperation [1604WKCA002]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [lzujbky-2015-K10, lzujbky-2016-862516, lzujbky-2017-it90]\",\"This research was supported by the Soft Science Project of Gansu province (1504ZKCA090-1), the National Natural Science Foundation of china (grant nos. 41671516,41701623, 51369003), the Foundation for Excellent Youth Scholars of NIEER, CAS, National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41661144046), a project supported by the Special Foundation for Gansu Province International Scientific Cooperation (1604WKCA002), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (lzujbky-2015-K10, lzujbky-2016-862516, lzujbky-2017-it90).\",,29.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,\"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA\",1672-6316,1993-0321,,J MT SCI-ENGL,J Mt.

With water and energy playing a critical role in socio-economic development, ensuring resource security is a top policy concern. However, achieving this efficiently requires taking into account the various links between the two sectors through their joint management. Feedback between the water and energy sectors exists across system life-cycles and links the resources both spatially and temporally. Tracking the impacts of policies made in one sector on the other can thus be complicated and several 'nexus' methodologies have beep developed to try and address these issues. However, the different physical, temporal and spatial characteristics of the water and energy systems present several hurdles in analyzing the two resources simultaneously. This paper overcomes many of these problems with a new, fully coupled water-energy optimization model. Based on a review of contemporary literature, the model develops an original methodology to hard-link the two systems in detail across spatial and temporal scales, as well as between individual system processes throughout the life-cycle of each resource. In addition, the model also tracks changes in water quality through each process, allowing for detailed accounting of the energy needs for water treatment. The methodology proposed in this paper can be used to investigate various cross-sectoral issues and policies such as: water availability and temperature impacts on power plant cooling; emission constraint and biofuel expansion planning impacts on water resources; and the implications of water infrastructure expansion on the energy system. The capabilities of the coupled model are investigated in an example case study for Spain. An integrated approach is shown to have several benefits including lower total costs, better resource efficiency and improved robustness for a wide range of variations in several uncertain parameters. Coupled water-energy planning thus provides a critical opportunity to improve resource security and prevent inefficient decisions which could exacerbate problems even further. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The urban infrastructure systems, or socio-technical systems providing these services are the major conduits through which natural resources are consumed and environmental impacts are generated. This paper aims to gauge the potential reductions in environmental and resources footprints through urban transformation, including the deployment of resource-efficient socio-technical systems and strategic densification. Using hybrid life cycle assessment approach combined with scenarios, we analyzed the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water use, metal consumption and land use of selected socio-technical systems in 84 cities from the present to 2050. The socio-technical systems analyzed are: (1) bus rapid transit with electric buses, (2) green commercial buildings, and (3) district energy. We developed a baseline model for each city considering gross domestic product, population density, and climate conditions. Then, we overlaid three scenarios on top of the baseline model: (1) decarbonization of electricity, (2) aggressive deployment of resource-efficient socio-technical systems, and (3) strategic urban densification scenarios to each city and quantified their potentials in reducing the environmental and resource impacts of cities by 2050. The results show that, under the baseline scenario, the environmental and natural resource footprints of all 84 cities combined would increase 58%-116% by 2050. The resource-efficient scenario along with strategic densification, however, has the potential to curve down GHG emissions to 17% below the 2010 level in 2050. Such transformation can also limit the increase in all resource footprints to less than 23% relative to 2010. This analysis suggests that resource-efficient urban infrastructure and decarbonization of electricity coupled with strategic densification have a potential to mitigate resources and environmental footprints of growing cities.\",\"[Bergesen, Joseph D.; Suh, Sangwon] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, 2400 Bren Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Baynes, Timothy M.] CSIRO, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Musango, Josephine Kaviti] Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Complex Syst Transit, Sch Publ Leadership Urban Modelling & Metab, Stellenbosch, South Africa\",\"Suh, S (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, 2400 Bren Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.\",suh@bren.ucsb.edu,,\"Suh, Sangwon/0000-0001-8290-6276\",,,,49.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,8.0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,\"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND\",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

But what if ecological processes operate across property boundaries and land use decisions on one property influence ecosystem functions on neighboring sites? This paper examines how to account for such spatial externalities when designing market-based conservation instruments. We use an agent-based model to analyze different spatial metrics and their implications on land use decisions in a dynamic cost environment. The model contains a number of alternative submodels which differ in incentive design and social interactions of agents, the latter including coordinating as well as cooperating behavior of agents. We find that incentive design and social interactions have a strong influence on the spatial allocation and the costs of the conservation market. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Regional forest agreements are 20-year federal-state agreements that underpin the conservation and management of forests in the major commercial forest regions of Australia, covering an area of 39 million ha, and aim to achieve a balance between conservation and sustainable use of the natural, cultural, economic and social values of these forests. The agreements constitute the largest intergovernmental natural resource planning process ever undertaken in Australia, as well as being mechanisms for meeting international obligations for the conservation and sustainable use of forest resources. Processes leading to these agreements were rational, objective and transparent, balancing conservation and sustainable development objectives, and were based on a wealth of knowledge and data. Scientific and economic frameworks were developed for determining conservation, sustainable management and industry development outcomes, that is, ecologically sustainable development. Ten regional forest agreements were signed by governments between 1997 and 2001. These agreements resulted in the implementation of comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve systems and improved systems of environmental management in public and private forests. They have also contributed to the sustainability of forest management and the conservation of biodiversity across all tenures. Regional forest agreements are examples of how governments can make decisions and respond to public policy issues about the ecological, social and economic demands on forest resources through a sustainability framework.\",\"[Davey, S.

One such region is Antarctica. This article describes the environmental conditions of Antarctica that decide its attractiveness for tourists, as well as its political and legal status. The factors that determine a tourist reception area of increasing intensity are analyzed. Based on the data of the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO), the volume of tourist traffic was determined, and environmental problems identified, which result from tourism development in Antarctica. The model of R.W. ButlerTourism Area Life Cycle (TALC)was used to analyze the development of tourism. By the middle of the second decade of the 21st century, the number of tourists in the Antarctic region exceeded 40 thousand, which seems to be the largest figure (the boom phase in the Butler cycle) in sheer numbers, and which resulted in the introduction of less tourist-friendly behavior, from the point of view of environmental protection.

In the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, these ecosystems rely on shallow groundwater to support their vegetation communities during the dry summer growing season in the region's Mediterranean montane climate. Vegetation composition in this environment is influenced by both (1) oxygen stress that occurs when portions of the root zone are saturated and anaerobic conditions limit root respiration and (2) water stress that occurs when the water table drops and the root zone becomes water limited. A spatially distributed watershed model that explicitly accounts for snowmelt processes was linked to a fine-resolution groundwater flow model of Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park, California, to simulate water table dynamics. This linked hydrologic model was calibrated to observations from a well observation network for 2006-2009. A vegetation survey was also conducted at the site in which the three dominant species were identified at more than 200 plots distributed across the meadow. Nonparametric multiplicative regression was performed to create and select the best models for predicting vegetation dominance on the basis of the simulated hydrologic regime. The hydrologic niches of three vegetation types representing wet, moist, and dry meadow vegetation communities were found to be best described using both (1) a sum exceedance value calculated as the integral of water table position above a depth threshold of oxygen stress and (2) a sum exceedance value calculated as the integral of water table position below a depth threshold of water stress. This linked hydrologic and vegetative modeling framework advances our ability to predict the propagation of human-induced climatic and land use or land cover changes through the hydrologic system to the ecosystem. The hydroecologic functioning of meadows provides an example of the extent to which cascading hydrologic processes at watershed, hillslope, and riparian zones and within channels are reflected in the composition and distribution of riparian vegetation.\",\"[Lowry, Christopher S.] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Geol, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Loheide, Steven P., II] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Madison, WI 53711 USA; [Moore, Courtney E.; Lundquist, Jessica D.] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA\",\"Lowry, CS (reprint author), SUNY Buffalo, Dept Geol, 411 Cooke Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.\",cslowry@buffalo.edu,\"Loheide, Steven/L-3132-2015\",\"Loheide, Steven/0000-0003-1897-0163; Lowry, Christopher/0000-0003-0512-964X\",\"National Science Foundation [CBET-0729838, CBET-0729830]\",\"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grants CBET-0729838 and CBET-0729830.

Yet the lack of long-term in situ monitoring data hinders the managerial capacity of changing water vapor environment, which is tied with sustaining the grassland in the Inner Mongolia. Environmental remote sensing monitoring and modeling may provide synergistic means of observing changes in thermodynamic balance during drought onset at the grassland surface, providing reliable projections accounting for variations and correlations of water vapor and heat fluxes. It is the aim of this paper to present a series of estimates of latent heat, sensible heat, and net radiation using an innovative first-principle, physics-based model (GEOMOD: GEO-model estimated the land surface heat with MODis data) with the aid of integrated satellite remote sensing and in situ eddy covariance data. Based on the energy balance principle and aerodynamics diffusion theory, the GEOMOD model is featured with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data with 250 m spatial resolution to collectively reflect the spatial heterogeneity of surface properties, supplement missing data with the neighborhood values across both spatial and temporal domains, estimate the surface roughness height and zero-plane displacement with dynamic look-up table, and implement a fast iterative algorithm to calculate sensible heat. Its analytical framework is designed against overreliance on local micro-meteorological parameters. Practical implementation was assessed in the study area, the Xilin Gol River Basin, a typical grassland environment, Northern China. With 179 days of MODIS data in support of modeling, coincident ground-based observations between 2000 and 2006 were selected for model calibration. The findings indicate that GEOMOD performs reasonably well in modeling the land surface heat exchange process, as demonstrated by a case study of Inner Mongolia.\",\"[Gao, Zhiqiang; Zhang, Wenjiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Gao, Zhiqiang; Gao, Wei] Colorado State Univ, USDA UV B Monitoring & Res Program, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA; [Gao, Zhiqiang; Gao, Wei] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ctr Remote Sensing & Modeling Agr Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA; [Gao, Zhiqiang; Zhang, Wenjiang; Gao, Wei] E China Normal Univ, Joint Lab Environm Remote Sensing & Data Assimila, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Chang, Ni-Bin] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA\",\"Gao, ZQ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, 11A Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.\",gaozq@igsnrr.ac.cn; wgao@uvb.nrel.colostate.edu; nchang@mail.ucf.edu,\"Gao, Wei/C-1430-2016; Young, Kristina/M-3069-2014\",,national key laboratory [1088RA400S]; National 973 Key Project of China [2006CB403404]; National Key Technology RD Program [2006BAB04A08]; USDA CSREES [2006-34263-16926],\"This work was collectively supported by creative group project of national key laboratory (1088RA400S), National 973 Key Project of China (2006CB403404), the project of \"\"The Modification of Meteorological Observation of Anhui Province based on Technology of Remote Sensing and Modeling\"\", National Key Technology R&D Program (2006BAB04A08) and USDA CSREES (g2006-34263-16926).\",\"Bastiaanssen WGM, 1998, J HYDROL, V212, P198, DOI 10.1016/S0022-1694(98)00253-4; Bastiaanssen WGM, 2000, J HYDROL, V229, P87, DOI 10.1016/S0022-1694(99)00202-4; Bastiaanssen WGM, 1998, J HYDROL, V212, P213, DOI 10.1016/S0022-1694(98)00254-6; Bastiaanssen WGM, 2001, IRRIGATION SCI, V21, P1; CHEN L, 2000, GEOGRAPHICAL RES, V19, P172; CHOUDHURY BJ, 1988, Q J ROY METEOR SOC, V114, P373, DOI 10.1002/qj.49711448006; DEARDORFF JW, 1978, J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS, V83, P1889, DOI 10.1029/JC083iC04p01889; DICKINSON RE, 1989, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V15, P383; Dyer A.

It lends an evolutionary perspective to how social-ecological interactions change. Thus, we argue that an improved understanding of how social-ecological systems have evolved up to the present is necessary for the modelling, understanding and anticipation of current and future social-ecological systems. Here we consider the implications of an evolutionary perspective for designing research approaches. One desirable approach is the creation of multi-decadal records produced by integrating palaeoenvironmental, instrument and documentary sources at multiple spatial scales. We also consider the potential for improved analytical and modelling approaches by developing system dynamical, cellular and agent-based models, observing complex behaviour in social-ecological systems against which to test systems dynamical theory, and drawing better lessons from history. Alongside these is the need to find more appropriate ways to communicate complex systems, risk and uncertainty to the public and to policy-makers.\",\"[Dearing, John A.; Edwards, Mary E.] Univ Southampton, Dept Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Bullock, Seth] Univ Southampton, Dept Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Costanza, Robert] Portland State Univ, Inst Sustainable Solut, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Dawson, Terry P.] Univ Dundee, Dept Geog, Dundee, Scotland; [Poppy, Guy M.] Univ Southampton, Dept Biol Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Smith, Graham M.] Univ Southampton, Dept Social Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England\",\"Dearing, JA (reprint author), Univ Southampton, Dept Geog & Environm, Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.\",j.dearing@soton.ac.uk,\"Poppy, Guy/D-7513-2012; Dawson, Terence/E-4724-2011; Dearing, John/E-4206-2010; Costanza, Robert/A-4912-2008\",\"Dawson, Terence/0000-0002-4314-1378; Costanza, Robert/0000-0001-6348-8734\",,,,93.0,28.0,29.0,1.0,57.0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,\"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA\",0364-152X,,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

We asked four questions: (1) does recent livestock and rabbit grazing reduce some plant attributes more strongly than others; (2) does grazing by introduced herbivores (i.e. livestock and rabbits) affect plants more strongly than native herbivores (i.e. kangaroos); (3) do the effects of recent livestock grazing differ from the legacy effects of livestock grazing; and (4) does the probability of occurrence of exotic plants increase with increasing net primary productivity (NPP)? LocationSouth-eastern Australia. MethodsWe measured the recent grazing activity of co-occurring livestock (cattle, sheep, goats), rabbits and kangaroos by counting faecal pellets; historic grazing activity by measuring livestock tracks; and derived NPP from satellite imagery. We used a hierarchical GLMM to simultaneously model the presence or absence (i.e. probability of occurrence) of all plant species as a function of their attributes (growth form, lifespan and origin) to assess their average response to recent grazing, historic grazing and productivity in a broad-scale regional study. ResultsRecent and historic livestock grazing, rabbit grazing and increasing NPP reduced the average probability of occurrence of plant species, although responses varied among plant attributes. Both recent and historic livestock grazing strongly reduced the average probability of occurrence of native species, and forbs and geophytes, but differed in their relative effects on other growth forms. Recent livestock grazing, rabbit grazing and NPP had similar effects, strongly reducing native species and forbs, geophytes, shrubs and sub-shrubs. The overall effects of recent kangaroo grazing were relatively weak, with no clear trends for any given plant attribute. ConclusionOur results highlight the complex nature of grazing by introduced herbivores compared with native herbivores on different plant attributes. Land managers need to be aware that domestic European livestock, rabbits and other free-ranging introduced livestock such as goats have detrimental impacts on native plant communities. Our results also show that kangaroo grazing has a relatively benign effect on plant occurrence.\",\"[Travers, Samantha K.] Univ New South Wales, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Eldridge, David J.] Univ New South Wales, Off Environm & Heritage, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Dorrough, Josh] Off Environm & Heritage, Merimbula, NSW, Australia; [Val, James] Off Environm & Heritage, Buronga, NSW, Australia; [Oliver, Ian] Off Environm & Heritage, Gosford, NSW, Australia; [Oliver, Ian] Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW, Australia\",\"Travers, SK (reprint author), Univ New South Wales, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\",s.travers@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,54.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,9.0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,\"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA\",1402-2001,1654-109X,,APPL VEG SCI,Appl.

Developed in collaboration with African-American survivors, the National Witness Project (NWP) is an evidence-based, community-led LHA program that improves cancer screening among African-American women. NWP has been successfully disseminated, replicated, and implemented nationally in over 40 sites in 22 states in diverse community settings, reaching over 15,000 women annually. We sought to advance understanding of barriers and facilitators to the long-term implementation and sustainability of LHA programs in community settings from the viewpoint of the LHAs, as well as the broader impact of the program on African-American communities and LHAs. In the context of a mixed-methods study, in-depth telephone interviews were conducted among 76 African-American LHAs at eight NWP sites at baseline and 12-18 months later, between 2010 and 2013. Qualitative data provides insight into inner and outer contextual factors (e.g., community partnerships, site leadership, funding), implementation processes (e.g., training), as well as characteristics of the intervention (e.g., perceived need and fit in African-American community) and LHAs (e.g., motivations, burnout) that are perceived to impact the continued implementation and sustainability of NWP. Factors at the contextual levels and related to motivations of LHAs are critical to the sustainability of LHA programs. We discuss how findings are used to inform (1) the development of the LHA Sustainability Framework and (2) strategies to support the continued implementation and sustainability of evidence-based LHA interventions in community settings.\",\"[Shelton, Rachel C.; Charles, Thana-Ashley; Dunston, Sheba King] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Sociomed Sci, 722 168th St,Room 941, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Dunston, Sheba King] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Hlth Stat, Quest Design Res Lab, Off Res & Methodol, 3311 Toledo Rd, Hyattsville, MD 20782 USA; [Jandorf, Lina] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Oncol Sci, 1 Gustave L Levy Pl,Box 1130, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Erwin, Deborah O.] Roswell Pk Canc Inst, Off Canc Hlth Dispar Res Canc Prevent & Populat S, Elm & Carlton St, Buffalo, NY 14263 USA\",\"Shelton, RC (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Sociomed Sci, 722 168th St,Room 941, New York, NY 10032 USA.\",rs3108@cumc.columbia.edu,,,National Cancer Institute [5R03CA150543-03]; Lerner Center for Public Health Promotion at Columbia School of Public Health,\"This research was funded by a grant from the National Cancer Institute (5R03CA150543-03, \"\"Serving as a Lay Health Advisor: The Impact on Self and Community\"\").

This pluralistic view of the natural world reconciles theory with empirical observations better than does either a strictly niche- or neutrality-based perspective. Even so, rules (or rules of thumb) that govern the relative contributions that niche-based and stochastic processes make as communities assemble remain only vaguely formulated and incompletely tested. For example, the translation of non-random (non-neutral) ecological processes, which differentially sort among species within a community, into species-compositional patterns may occur more influentially within some demographic subsets of organisms than within others. In other words, the relative contributions of niche vs. neutral processes may vary among age-, size-, or stage-classes. For example, non-random patterns of mortality that occur among seedlings in a rain forest, or among newly settled juveniles in communities of sessile marine communities, could be more influential than non-random mortality during later stages in determining overall community diversity. We propose two alternative, mutually compatible, hypotheses to account for different levels of influence from mortality among life-cycle stages toward producing non-random patterns in organismal communities. The Turnover Model simply posits that those demographic classes characterized by faster rates of turnover contribute greater influence in the short-term as sufficient mortality gives rise to non-random changes to the community, as well as over the longer-term as multiple individuals of a given fast-turnover demographic class transition into later classes compared to each individual that ratchets from a slow-turnover starting class into a later class. The Turnover Model should apply to most communities of organisms. The Niche Model, which posits that niche-based processes are more influential in some demographic classes relative to others, may alternatively or additionally apply to communities. We also propose several alternative mechanisms, especially relevant to forest trees, that could cause dynamics consistent with the Niche Model. These mechanisms depend on differences among demographic classes in the extent of demographic variation that individual organisms experience through their trait values or neighborhood conditions.\",\"[Green, Peter T.] La Trobe Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Evolut, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Harms, Kyle E.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA\",\"Harms, KE (reprint author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.\",kharms@lsu.edu,,,Australian Long-Term Ecological Research Network,\"The authors contributed equally to this work.

A sustainable urban transport system balances social, economic, and environmental goals through inclusive decision-making. Public acceptability of sustainable transport measures is a challenge for developing cities such as Dhaka, where mobility to all income groups of the society needs to be ensured without hampering environmental balance and road safety condition. This paper sets out a comprehensive analysis of how people perceive different attributes of sustainability of the existing transport operation in Dhaka. Considering the unavailability of a standardized set of indicators to evaluate transport sustainability performance in Dhaka, this research identified a set of 14 subjective indicators based on an extensive literature survey and local expert opinion. The study explored a high level of user displeasure over the transport sustainability performance in the city. Travel time, women accessibility, and safety were identified as the top priority indicators in terms of user disgruntlement where cost issue generated fewer complaints. Variation of perception of different social groups have been explored to find that young, educated, and high-income respondents are the most concerned about sustainability issues. The research concluded discussing the probable acceptability or risk of a few transport policies based on the findings. The study developed a framework for investigating transport sustainability performance with subjective indicators that may assist policy makers in promoting inclusive decisions through the efficient use of resources.\",\"[Munira, Sirajum] Texas A&M Univ, 400 Bizzell St, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [San Santoso, Djoen] Asian Inst Technol, B4 Klong Luang, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand\",\"Munira, S (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, 400 Bizzell St, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.\",munira_silvy@hotmail.com; djoensan@yahoo.com,,,,,,74.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,18.0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,\"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS\",2213-624X,2213-6258,,CASE STUD TRANSP POL,Case Stud.

The dynamics of R&D practices in knowledge creation arise from complementary practices of exploration and exploitation undertaken over the lifespan of an inter organizational project that trigger an ambidextrous process of innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This study involves interpretative guidance. We elaborate upon the history of the development of a collaborative R&D project in an intensive knowledge industry, the semiconductor industry, and use narrative as the methodological framework in a single case study with a processual approach. We conducted 65 interviews that were supported by secondary inventories of data that consisted of 167 files. Findings: The type of collaborative practice adopted in a joint R&D project varies based on the stocks of knowledge required to make the concept a reality and also as a strategy of knowledge creation adopted in each project phase, ensuring a dynamic synthesis between tacit and explicit knowledge. We propose a three-dimensional model that accounts for the adoption of different practices throughout the life cycle of a collaborative ambidextrous R&D project. Practical implications: We identified 19 collaborative practices of inter-organizational knowledge creation that ensure the dynamics of innovation using complementary exploration and exploitation approaches. Originality/Value: This study makes important contributions to the relational view and the theory of knowledge creation, offering a contribution to understanding the origin of ambidextrous practices in knowledge creation throughout the life cycle of an R&D project.\",\"[Faccin, Kadigia; Balestrin, Alsones] Unisinos Univ, Business Sch, Av Unisinos 950, BR-93022000 Sao Leopoldo, RS, Brazil\",\"Faccin, K (reprint author), Unisinos Univ, Business Sch, Av Unisinos 950, BR-93022000 Sao Leopoldo, RS, Brazil.\",kadigiaf@unisinos.br; abalestrin@unisinos.br,,\"Balestrin, Alsones/0000-0001-6397-1582\",,,,67.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,5.0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,\"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS\",0923-4748,1879-1719,,J ENG TECHNOL MANAGE,J.

This process threatens local grassland biomes as well as the livelihoods of farm families that utilize these grasslands. In the Rio de la Plata grasslands region meat production and multispecies native grasslands have coexisted for more than 400 years. Low levels of meat productivity and farm income, however, trigger replacement of native grasslands by crops and leys and threaten the survival of local beef farming systems. We studied the economic and environmental performance of beef farming in the region based on interviews and field measurements on 280 case study farms with the following aims: (a) to identify the multi-functional economic and environmental performance of beef farms across the Rio de la Plata grasslands biome; (b) to identify farms with 'outstanding' multi-functional performance; (c) to compare performance levels with those found in other regions; and (d) to discuss the implications of the outstanding farms for the development of new systems of meat production. The representativeness of the case study farms was ascertained by comparing them with a farm typology constructed from survey data of 15,448 beef farms situated predominantly on native grasslands in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. We identified seven farm types on the basis of farm size, labour, farm specialization, land use and stocking rate. We identified positive deviant farms based on Pareto-ranking and compared these with a classification based on threshold values provided by experts. Out of the 280 farms, 41 were ranked as Pareto-optimal, i.e. out-performed other farms in one or more indicators without being outperformed in other indicators. Out of these, 5 were positive deviants, achieving on average 192 kg LW ha(-1) yr(-1) of livestock productivity and 201 US$ ha(-1) year(-1) farm income, having most favourable values for fossil energy consumption, phosphorus balance, carbon footprint and having over 95% of their land under native grassland as a proxy for biodiversity conservation value. Four of these farms belonged to farm types that together represented 55% of the population, suggesting scope for widescale improvement. Compared to the values reported for the OECD countries the beef farming systems of the Rio de la Plata grasslands region consume less energy and positive deviant farms demonstrated approximately average livestock productivity and carbon footprint. Increasing livestock productivity in the Rio de la Plata grasslands region resulted in a stronger decline of the carbon footprint without compromising the current negligible levels of fossil fuel energy use. Further elucidation of management practices that lead to positive deviant performance will require modelling of the interaction of pasture and herd dynamics at farm level and is needed to support targeted policy support for sustainable natural grassland-based beef production in the region.\",\"[Modernel, P.; Alvarez, S.; Tittonell, P.; Rossing, W.

The current expectation is for the expansion of these crops to continue. This creates concern over the extent to which the full implications of large scale land use change are currently being, considered by decision-makers. Using the State of Sao Paulo as a case study (as it accounts for the majority of sugar cane grown in Brazil), a comparison was made of the impacts identified in Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) and Preliminary Environmental Reports (PERs), which have to be submitted for approval of most new sugar cane activities, with significant impacts known to be associated with sugar cane activities derived from literature review. The results from a review of 32 EISs and PERs (30% of the population) indicated that whilst some impacts were well covered by the sample (water and soil pollution, and air emissions) energy balance and Green House Gas emissions and food security had very limited consideration, and water resources, residues, labour conditions and social responsibility were only partially covered. Environmental Impact Assessment is constrained by its environmental advocacy role and its application to the project level only. This study highlights its limitations in the context of assessment of land use change which demands more strategic consideration. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Consequentially, the British Standards Institution recently launched a new standard \"\"BS 8001:2017 - Framework for implementing the principles of the circular economy in organizations\"\". BS 8001:2017 tries to reconcile the far-reaching ambitions of the CE with established business routines. The standard contains a comprehensive list of CE terms and definitions, a set of general CE principles, a flexible management framework for implementing CE strategies in organizations, and a detailed description of economic, environmental, design, marketing, and legal issues related to the CE. The guidance on monitoring CE strategy implementation, however, remains vague. The standard stipulates that organizations are solely responsible for choosing appropriate CE indicators. Its authors do not elaborate on the links between CE strategy monitoring and the relevant and already standardized quantitative tools life cycle assessment (LCA) and material flow cost accounting (MFCA). Here a general system definition for deriving CE indicators is proposed. Based on the system definition and the indicator literature a dashboard of new and established quantitative indicators for CE strategy assessment in organizations is then compiled. The dashboard indicators are mostly based on material flow analysis (MFA), MFCA, and LCA. Steel cycle data are used to illustrate potential core CE indicators, notably, the residence time of a material in the techno-sphere (currently 250-300 years for steel). Moreover, organizations need to monitor their contribution to in use-stock growth, a central driver of resource depletion and hindrance to closing material cycles.\",\"[Pauliuk, Stefan] Univ Frethurg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Ind Ecol Grp, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany\",\"Pauliuk, S (reprint author), Univ Frethurg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Ind Ecol Grp, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.\",stefan.pauliuk@indecol.uni-freiburg.de,,,\"Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts of Baden Wurttemberg (Germany) [7635.521(15)]\",\"This work was supported by grant no. 7635.521(15) from the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts of Baden Wurttemberg (Germany).\",,129.0,3.0,3.0,16.0,21.0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,\"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS\",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

Economic growth and environmental protection can go hand in hand, provided that decision makers develop and use tools and insights targeting in the implementation of successful and robust long term policies. This paper was developed in the framework of a European research project and implements a Multicriteria Mathematical Programming model that optimises the sustainable management of agricultural regions taking in account the available resources (land, labour, capital) and environmental parameters (agrochemicals, water consumption). The model achieves the optimum farm plan in the area combining different criteria to a utility function under a set of constraints and the spatial integration of the vulnerability maps of the regions into the model enables the regional authorities to design policies for the optimal agricultural development and the groundwater protection from the agricultural land uses. Furthermore, the model is used to simulate different scenarios and policies by the local stakeholders, due to changes on different social, economic and environmental parameters. In this way the decision makers can achieve alternative farm plans and agricultural land uses as well as to estimate economic, social and environmental impacts of different policies. The model has been applied to an agricultural region in Northern Greece and proved to be a valuable tool in the implementation of environmental policies and actions, especially in agricultural regions in a delicate balance as the study area.

Dairy industry is one of the most important food activities in this geographical region; only fish processing industry (data from 2014) precedes its annual turnover. Research related to sustainability in this sector has proved that farming is the most polluting process associated to the life cycle. Nevertheless, the prevention and control of emissions to air, water and soil, as well as waste generation derived from the industrial process, cannot be omitted. This is the objective of the Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions (Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control, IPPC). The industrial activities included in its Annex I (as the dairy industry) must, among others, implement the Best Available Techniques (BATs), to achieve a high level of protection of the environment taken as a whole. This paper analyses the degree of implementation of the IPPC Directive in the dairy industry of Galicia, selecting 5 dairy industrial installations in the framework of the IPPC. The used methodology was proposed previously and applied for validation to the fish and seafood caning industry (Bello Bugallo et al., 2013). The environmental performance of these plants was analysed using, among others, the first environmental permits and taking into account the last modifications published in the official journal, as a source of information about the degree of implementation of the BAT and the associated emission levels. The results give an updated inventory of BAT for the dairy industry, the comparative between plants, the number of implemented BAT, the emissions and the overall environmental performance of each plant. The main conclusions indicate that the degree of implementation of BAT is, in general, quite poor especially those related to waste management. The 2 plants \"\"theoretically\"\" with the largest number of BAT implemented are the most pollutant ones (taken into account emissions). The reason is not that BATs are not effective but every plant has its particularities (age, the kind of fuel used, and so on) and therefore, each one has its own needs from an environmental point of view. Then BAT should be selected for the most pollutant flows, the so called Improvable Flows (IF). These IF must be identified previously with adequate tools, followed by the selection of the appropriate BATs from an updated inventory. This analysis could be extrapolated and applied to the rest of the installations of this sector. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\",\"[Torres Lopez, E.

In asking \"\"Who made quantum theory popular?\"\" I investigate whether this unusual congress introduced a kind of mechanism - institutional, disciplinary, popularizing or other - that had been recognized and applied also elsewhere. My interpretation of the early Solvay conferences, on the one hand, dispenses with linear stories often found with older accounts, e.g. that the Solvay meetings Nos. 1, 2 and 5 supposedly laid the foundations of quantum theory altogether. On the other hand, I attempt at dispelling the \"\"three miracles\"\" Peter Galison (2007) has found in the history of the first Solvay meeting. He was right to stress that the meetings were not so much spectacular turning points in the history of physics but rather \"\"served as sites for powerful reviews of the field\"\" and were \"\"catalysts for intellectual and social networks\"\". However, neither the \"\"precise balance between two philantropic forces\"\" in Ernest Solvay's motivation, nor Lorentz's brilliant guidance of the discourse, nor the \"\"presence and prior contributions\"\" of Einstein, I would like to be willing to qualify in any way as miracles. There were good reasons, I argue, to give Lorentz the role he filled, and to invite Einstein; also Nernst may have made it clear enough to Solvay, what role would give him the most appreciation. My thesis is that the success of the first Solvay meeting did not much rely on miracles, but was a successful unfolding of a meticulously devised model - call it the Solvay model, or probably more accurately, the Nernst model. This model can be characterized as an externally-funded, agenda-setting, high-profile and international meeting of scientists concerned with one novel scientific problem or field, where select pre-circulated papers of some participants were discussed with more invited discussants, and later its papers and discussions were published for reaching a broader scientific audience as well as informing a more general audience, and all this with the aim to have follow-up meetings as well as a grant giving institution promoting research in the chosen field. For such a model, it obviously needed a Nernst, a Solvay and an interested scientific community, or to put it more generally, an organizer driven by a scientific problem he had encountered and which he wanted to dominate, a Philantropy that can offer funds and institutional resources, and also some disciplinary space, within which a new scientific subfield can be established. I test this model with two cases, which may be called Solvay 1.5 and Solvay 16.5, relating to high-profile meetings at Gottingen in 1913 and San Francisco in 1977.\",\"Humboldt Univ, Inst Geschichtswissensch, D-10099 Berlin, Germany\",\"Schirrmacher, A (reprint author), Humboldt Univ, Inst Geschichtswissensch, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.\",Arne.Schirrmacher@hu-berlin.de,,,,,,26.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,\"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY\",1951-6355,1951-6401,,EUR PHYS J-SPEC TOP,Eur.

Understanding local norms and values is thought to provide insight into how issues are defined and what interventions might be considered practical. Communities in this framework are not just the physical locations at which programs are targeted, but are actively constructed spaces that must be properly understood. In many ways, the field of public health has been sensitive to this understanding and has elevated the community in importance, thus emphasizing that significant features are variable and locally defined. Even in the new public health, however, empirical indicators are still often relied on, thereby leading to the increasing standardization of communities, rather than to openness to neighborhood particularities. For this reason, a community-based focus should guide future public health endeavors. Most important, this strategy underscores the importance of getting to know the communities in which symptoms, illness and care are defined, and allows for full participation by community members that make interventions both relevant and sustainable.\",\"[Murphy, John W.] Univ Miami, Sociol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Franz, Berkeley] Ohio Univ, Heritage Coll Osteopath Med, Dept Social Med, Athens, OH 45701 USA\",\"Franz, B (reprint author), Dept Social Med, Grosvenor Hall 311, Athens, OH USA.\",franzb@ohio.edu,,,,,,59.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,10.0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,\"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND\",1754-9973,1754-9981,,PUBLIC HEALTH ETH-UK,Public Health Ethics,NOV,2017.0,10,3,,,,,289,297,,10.1093/phe/phw041,,,,9.0,\"Ethics; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Ethics\",\"Social Sciences - Other Topics; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Ethics\",FL7EC,WOS:000414408400008,,,,,2018-07-06\n",

However, few studies have attempted to quantitatively separate their relative influences upon recruitment dynamics. Here we use 12 study sites spanning 250 km of the northern Chile upwelling ecosystem and the intertidal barnacles Jehlius cirratus and Notochthamalus scabrosus to examine the extent to which spatial variation in larval recruitment is related to environmental variability and how these relationships depend on spatial autocorrelation. We find that upwelling intensity and wind velocity are negatively related to larval recruitment while surface slicks showed a positive correlation. However, the pure effect of each environmental variable was lower than its combined effects. Taking spatial autocorrelation into account, we find that the spatially structured variation of upwelling dynamics, distance to upwelling fronts, wind velocity, and slick occurrence explained most of the variation in barnacle recruitment. Spatial variation in recruitment rates of barnacles showed a characteristic length scale of 60-70 km, similar to the scale estimated for the spatially structured variables (upwelling, wind velocity, and surface slicks). We find that conditions for the occurrence of surface slicks (as surrogates of internal waves activity) seem to operate across several sites, suggesting a meso-instead local-scale influence over spatial variation in barnacle recruitment. Our results suggest that spatial variation in barnacle recruitment is modulated by the combined influence of several spatially structured nearshore processes operating at scales of 60-70 km and that spatial autocorrelation must be taken into account in the study of the recruitment-environment relationship. However, the influence of local and small-scale factors on recruitment dynamics of benthic invertebrates should be interpreted cautiously.\",\"[Lagos, Nelson A.; Castilla, Juan Carlos] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Castilla, Juan Carlos; Broitman, Bernardo R.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Santiago, Chile; [Broitman, Bernardo R.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA\",\"Lagos, NA (reprint author), Univ Santo Tomas, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Ejercito 146, Santiago, Chile.\",nlagoss@ust.cl,\"Broitman, Bernardo/D-6007-2013\",\"Broitman, Bernardo/0000-0001-6582-3188\",,,\"Aiken CM, 2007, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V339, P13, DOI 10.3354/meps339013; Archambault P, 1999, J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL, V238, P161, DOI 10.1016/S0022-0981(98)00146-4; Archambault P, 1996, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V136, P111, DOI 10.3354/meps136111; Astorga A, 2003, ECOL LETT, V6, P420, DOI 10.1046/j.1461-0248.2003.00445.x; Barth JA, 2000, DEEP-SEA RES PT II, V47, P783, DOI 10.1016/S0967-0645(99)00127-7; Belgrano A, 1995, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V128, P43, DOI 10.3354/meps128043; Belgrano A, 1995, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V128, P51, DOI 10.3354/meps128051; Bjornstad ON, 1999, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V14, P427, DOI 10.1016/S0169-5347(99)01677-8; Bolker BM, 2003, AM NAT, V162, P135, DOI 10.1086/376575; BORCARD D, 1992, ECOLOGY, V73, P1045, DOI 10.2307/1940179; BOTSFORD L, 2001, ICES J MAR SCI, V10, P1; Broitman BR, 2005, LIMNOL OCEANOGR, V50, P1473, DOI 10.4319/lo.2005.50.5.1473; Caley MJ, 1996, ANNU REV ECOL SYST, V27, P477, DOI 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.27.1.477; Camus PA, 1996, REV CHIL HIST NAT, V69, P193; Castilla JC, 2002, OCEANOGRAPHY ECOLOGY, P179; Clark JS, 1999, ECOLOGY, V80, P1475, DOI 10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1475:SDNAFP]2.0.CO;2; Connolly SR, 1998, AM NAT, V151, P311, DOI 10.1086/286121; Connolly SR, 2001, ECOLOGY, V82, P1799, DOI 10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[1799:ALGIRO]2.0.CO;2; Cowen RK, 2006, SCIENCE, V311, P522, DOI 10.1126/science.1122039; CRISP DJ, 1962, PROC R SOC SER B-BIO, V156, P500, DOI 10.1098/rspb.1962.0052; Eastman R.

However, most studies did not include environmental factors in the statistical models, introducing a bias to estimate geriatric depression risk because the urban environment was found to have significant associations with mental health. We developed a cross-sectional study with a binomial logistic regression to examine the geriatric depression risk of a high-density city based on five social vulnerability factors and four environmental measures. We constructed a socio-environmental vulnerability index by including the significant variables to map the geriatric depression risk in Hong Kong, a high-density city characterized by compact urban environment and high-rise buildings. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of the variables were significantly different, indicating that both social and environmental variables should be included as confounding factors. For the comprehensive model controlled by all confounding factors, older adults who were of lower education had the highest geriatric depression risks (OR: 1.60 (1.21, 2.12)). Higher percentage of residential area and greater variation in building height within the neighborhood also contributed to geriatric depression risk in Hong Kong, while average building height had negative association with geriatric depression risk. In addition, the socio-environmental vulnerability index showed that higher scores were associated with higher geriatric depression risk at neighborhood scale. The results of mapping and cross-section model suggested that geriatric depression risk was associated with a compact living environment with low socio-economic conditions in historical urban areas in Hong Kong. In conclusion, our study found a significant difference in geriatric depression risk between unadjusted and adjusted models, suggesting the importance of including environmental factors in estimating geriatric depression risk. We also developed a framework to map geriatric depression risk across a city, which can be used for identifying neighborhoods with higher risk for public health surveillance and sustainable urban planning.\",\"[Ho, Hung Chak; Lau, Kevin Ka-Lun; Ng, Edward] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Environm Energy & Sustainabil, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ho, Hung Chak] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lau, Kevin Ka-Lun; Ng, Edward] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Future Cities, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lau, Kevin Ka-Lun; Yu, Ruby; Wang, Dan; Woo, Jean; Kwok, Timothy Chi Yui] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, CUHK Jockey Club Inst Ageing, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Ruby; Woo, Jean; Kwok, Timothy Chi Yui] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Med & Therapeut, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kwok, Timothy Chi Yui] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Jockey Club Ctr Osteoporosis Care & Control, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ng, Edward] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Architecture, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China\",\"Ho, HC; Lau, KKL (reprint author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Environm Energy & Sustainabil, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Ho, HC (reprint author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Lau, KKL (reprint author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Future Cities, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Lau, KKL (reprint author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, CUHK Jockey Club Inst Ageing, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.\",derrick.hc.ho@polyu.edu.hk; kevinlau@cuhk.edu.hk; rubyyu@cuhk.edu.hk; 1155058927@link.cuhk.edu.hk; jeanwoowong@cuhk.edu.hk; tkwok@cuhk.edu.hk; edwardng@cuhk.edu.hk,\"Yu, Ruby/N-5006-2015; Lau, Kevin Ka-Lun/Q-9139-2016; Kwok, Timothy/C-3725-2008; Ho, Hung Chak/W-3320-2017; Woo, Jean/K-2625-2014\",\"Lau, Kevin Ka-Lun/0000-0003-3438-1182; Kwok, Timothy/0000-0001-9253-3549; Ho, Hung Chak/0000-0002-6505-3504; Woo, Jean/0000-0001-7593-3081\",\"Chinese University of Hong Kong, through the project entitled \"\"CUHK Jockey Club Institute of Ageing-Research Initiatives\"\" [VCF2015003]\",\"The present work is supported by Vice-Chancellor's One-off Discretionary Fund of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, through the project entitled \"\"CUHK Jockey Club Institute of Ageing-Research Initiatives\"\" (Ref No. VCF2015003).\",,81.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,12.0,MDPI AG,BASEL,\"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND\",1660-4601,,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Modelling approaches are a useful tool for studying such a complex coastal environment. In this study, we carried out the development of a three-dimensional coupled hydrodynamical-biogeochemical model of the south-west lagoon of New Caledonia. The biogeochemical model presented in Faure et al. (2006, 2010) was dynamically coupled with a hydrodynamical model (MARS3D) in order to study the short-term variability of the ecosystem. Two simulations (in winter and summer) were then performed from measured initial conditions using realistic wind and irradiance conditions and river inputs. Examinations of the biogeochemical response to these transient meteorological conditions were presented and compared with temporal field data corresponding to the considered periods. Results highlighted the ecosystem functioning, based on the balance of hydrodynamical and biogeochemical processes. Influence of urban and terrigeneous inputs were limited to the coastal zone. The model accurately reproduced the measured Chl.a and bacterial production, highlighting the improvement made on the biogeochemical model. However, the underestimation of some variables in model outputs, in particular nutrients, led us to focus on different inputs, such as sediment inputs which were not taken into account or properly estimated. Moreover, the role of boundary waters appeared crucial and suggested a calibration effort. Last, the final aim of our modelling study will help the development of a useful tool for studying the key processes of the ecosystem of the south-west lagoon of New Caledonia, as well as the examination of the biogeochemical response under different scenarios.

Although the issues of elderly people's health and their POS needs are receiving increasing attention, research on continuous improvement strategies for POS for healthy aging societies is still limited. Hence, this study explored continuous improvement strategies thoroughly and systematically by using the DANP-V model. The findings revealed cognitive differences between expert and elderly groups. Moreover, water features, waste management, and co-maintenance spaces were the three criteria with the largest gap value. POS improvement has previously been implemented based on a priority order ranked from the criterion with largest gap value to the criterion with the smallest one. However, an alternative approach based on the cause-effect relationship is proposed in this paper. The study findings have both theoretical and practical implications for POS planners and designers.\",\"[Zhu, Bo-Wei] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Human & Arts, Avenida Wai Long, Taipa 999078, Macau, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jia-Rui; Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung; Huang, Shan-Lin] Natl Taipei Univ, Coll Publ Affairs, Grad Inst Urban Planning, 151 Univ Rd, New Taipei 23741, Taiwan; [Zhang, Jia-Rui] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, 100 West Ring Rd, Guangzhou 510006, Panyu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Shan-Lin] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Zhongshan Inst, 1 Xueyuan Rd, Zhongshan 528402, Shiqi, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Lei] Asia Univ, Coll Creat Design, 500 Lioufeng Rd, Taichung 41354, Taiwan\",\"Tzeng, GH (reprint author), Natl Taipei Univ, Coll Publ Affairs, Grad Inst Urban Planning, 151 Univ Rd, New Taipei 23741, Taiwan.\",zhubowei301@gmail.com; zhang0057@gmail.com; ghtzeng@gm.ntpu.edu.tw; samlin0668@gmail.com; kmt20005@yahoo.com,,,\"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST-104-2410-H-305-052-MY3]\",\"The authors are extremely grateful for the Sustainability journal editorial team's valuable comments on improving the quality of this article.

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a questionnaire survey of business dependencies on twenty-six different ES in the English county of Dorset, where the environment supports a significant component of the local economy. Responses were received from 212 businesses across twenty-eight sectors. While virtually all businesses (98%) were familiar with the concept of ES, dependency on ES was highly divided with 50% of businesses surveyed claiming no dependence on any ES flows. The highest businesses dependencies reported in this study were for regulating services with the ES of water quality and waste water treatment being of particular importance to businesses. The results however, advised that greater efforts are needed in highlighting the indirect benefits provided by Dorset's ecosystems, with eight business sectors (58% of respondents) claiming no or little dependence on supporting and habitat services including the ES of biodiversity, habitats for species and maintenance of genetic diversity. Many businesses also indicated little or no dependence on the globally important ES of pollination and soil condition, which may reflect a lack of awareness of dependencies occurring upstream of their value chains. At the sector level, businesses directly involved in protecting, extracting, or manufacturing raw materials were found to be more dependent on provisioning, regulatory and supporting ES than those operating in the service sector who favored cultural ES. These results highlight the value of assessing business dependencies on ES flows, which could usefully inform environmental management and accounting systems and improve monitoring of business performance, and thereby contribute to achievement of sustainability goals.\",\"[Watson, Stephen C.

However, since the demand for finite resources continues to increase, the sustainability of current production and consumption patterns is questioned both in developed and developing countries. A transition towards an economy based on biotic renewable resources (bio-economy) is considered necessary in order to support a steady provision of resources, representing an alternative to an economy based on fossil and abiotic resources. However, to ensure a sustainable use of biotic resources, there is the need of properly accounting for their use along supply chains as well as defining a robust and comprehensive impact assessment model. Since so far naturally occurring biotic resources have gained little attention in impact assessment methods, such as life cycle assessment, the aim of this study is to enable the inclusion of biotic resources in the assessment of products and supply chains. This paper puts forward a framework for biotic resources assessment, including: i) the definition of system boundaries between ecosphere and technosphere, namely between naturally occurring and man-made biotic resources; ii) a list of naturally occurring biotic resources which. have a commercial value, as basis for building life cycle inventories (NOBR, e.g. wild animals, plants etc); iii) an impact pathway to identify potential impacts on both resource provision and ecosystem quality; iv) a renewability-based indicator (NOBRri) for the impact assessment of naturally occurring biotic resources, including a list of associated characterization factors. The study, building on a solid review of literature and of available statistical data, highlights and discusses the critical aspects and paradoxes related to biotic resource inclusion in LCA: from the system boundaries definition up to the resource characterization.

There are times when these uses contribute to ecosystem degradation that may eventually lead to a systems' collapse. In addition to studies of technical means for predicting and controlling the systems, the understanding of human dimensions, institutional and social-interaction issues has been considered important for improving effective governance of these systems. This paper presents a multilevel analytical framework and discusses application of this framework to the context of three MPAs in Vietnam. It discusses the development of the framework based on a new perspective that views institutions as a structure and governance as a process for operating a governing system. As a result, inter-relations and mutual influences of institutions and governance occurred within the MPAs are illustrated as a cause effect relationship diagram. These are grouped into three components (i) formal institutions; (ii) political behaviour and organizational structure; and (iii) local communities' engagement, social capital and socio-economic conditions. These components interact with each other and influence the interplays of actors, both state and non-state, for MPA governance. Findings from this study suggest that institutions should be adaptive and regularly amended based on their performance in real-world governance processes. This ensures the match between the approved institutions and their practical effects in complex contextual conditions. Meanwhile, there should be accountable and transparent dialogues and mechanisms for all the stakeholders and actors to be actively involved in the development of institutions, and evaluating and monitoring governance processes. Bridging actors or organizations also need to be available as active facilitators of these dialogues and mechanisms. When the institutional and social-interaction issues are solved, governance of coupled human-natural systems, such as MPAs, will be enhanced. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, since lack of realism is inherent to all experimental science, if lack of realism invalidates microcosm models of ecological processes, then such lack of realism must either also invalidate much of the rest of experimental ecology or its force with respect to microcosm studies must derive from some other limitation of microcosm apparatus. We believe that the logic of the microcosm program for ecological research has been misunderstood. Here, we respond to the criticism that microcosm studies play at most a heuristic role in ecology with a new account of scientific experimentation developed specifically with ecology and other environmental sciences in mind. Central to our account are the concepts of model-based reasoning and analogical inference. We find that microcosm studies are sound when they serve as models for nature and when certain properties, referred to as the essential properties, are in positive analogy. By extension, our account also justifies numerous other kinds of ecological experimentation.

The development of small towns is an important way to Chinese urbanisation. Land use plays a very important role in the development of small towns. However there are many problems in the development of small towns, esp. in land use. The paper first discusses the land problems in the development of small towns. Such as much cultivated land lies idle, under-utilization and waste of land, increasing illegal use of land, unstable contractual relationship for land use. The relationship between the development of small towns and land use is also studied. Then the guidelines for the land system innovations of small towns are put forward. Namely the sustainability of social and economic development, the balance between land reservation and land utilization, the provision of service to village, agriculture and farmer, the management of land resource and land assets, the parsimonious and legal use of land. The basic framework of land system innovations of small towns is put forward finally. It include the land replacement policy for small towns and the permanent tenancy of farmland, the overall plan for land uses and other plans in harmony, the establishment of a flexible system of land supplies, using land with payments, the transfer of agricultural land and refining the land law related to the construction of small towns.\",\"[Liang Liu-ke] Henan Univ, Coll Environm & Planning, Kaifeng 475001, Peoples R China; [Chang Jiang; Borchard, K.] Univ Bonn, Inst Urban Planning Land Management & Water Engn, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Liang Liu-ke; Wu Ci-fang] Zhejiang Univ, Coll SE Land Management, Hangzhou 310029, Zhejiang, Peoples R China\",\"Liang, LK (reprint author), Henan Univ, Coll Environm & Planning, Kaifeng 475001, Peoples R China.\",,,,,,,13.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,\"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA\",1002-0063,,,CHINESE GEOGR SCI,Chin.

The energy modelling studies for Turkey mainly focus on usage of renewable energy and local fossil fuels and include nuclear power plants (NPP) only with their electricity generation capacities without taking into consideration the front- and back-ends of the nuclear fuel cycle. This study takes into consideration the life cycle assessment (LCA) of nuclear energy based on optimisation of energy system costs and usage of energy resources under atmospheric CO2 and SO2 emission constraints using MESSAGE iteratively with an industrial simulation model. This iterative modelling calculates the marginal costs of final energy generation and energy demands for domestic production.

Nowadays, the incidence of many risk factors for road crashes of cyclists remains largely unexplained. Given the importance of this issue, the present study has been conducted with the aim of determining relationships between infrastructural, human factors and safety outcomes of cyclists. Objectives: This study aimed, first, to examine the relationship between key infrastructural and human factors present in cycling, bicycle-user characteristics and their self-reported experience with road crashes. And second, to determine whether a set of key infrastructural and human factors may predict their self-reported road crashes. Methods: For this cross-sectional study, a total of 1064 cyclists (38.8% women, 61.2% men; M = 32.8 years of age) from 20 different countries across Europe, South America and North America, participated in an online survey composed of four sections: demographic data and cycling-related factors, human factors, perceptions on infrastructural factors and road crashes suffered. Results: The results of this study showed significant associations between human factors, infrastructural conditions and self-reported road crashes. Also, a logistic regression model found that self-reported road crashes of cyclists could be predicted through variables such as age, riding intensity, risky behaviours and problematic user/infrastructure interactions. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that self-reported road crashes of cyclists are influenced by features related to the user and their interaction with infrastructural characteristics of the road.\",\"[Useche, Sergio; Alonso, Francisco] Univ Valencia, INTRAS Res Inst Traff & Rd Safety, DATS Dev & Advising Traff Safety Res Grp, Carrer del Serpis 29,3rd Floor, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Montoro, Luis] Univ Valencia, INTRAS Res Inst Traff & Rd Safety, FACTHUM Lab, Human Factor & Rd Safety Res Grp, Carrer del Serpis 29,1st Floor, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar] QUT, Fac Hlth, CARRS Q, 130 Victoria Pk Rd, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4059, Australia\",\"Useche, S (reprint author), Univ Valencia, INTRAS Res Inst Traff & Rd Safety, DATS Dev & Advising Traff Safety Res Grp, Carrer del Serpis 29,3rd Floor, Valencia 46022, Spain.\",sergio.useche@uv.es; luis.montoro@uv.es; francisco.alonso@uv.es; oscar.oviedotrespalacios@qut.edu.au,,\"Alonso, Francisco/0000-0002-9482-8874; Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar/0000-0001-5916-3996; Useche, Sergio/0000-0002-5099-4627\",,,,55.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,MDPI AG,BASEL,\"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND\",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2018.0,10,2,,,,,,,299,10.3390/su10020299,,,,11.0,GREEN & SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FX3BB,WOS:000425943100022,,gold,,,2018-07-06\n",

Rather than being measured directly, the hydraulic residence time is usually inferred from estimates of watershed size, precipitation, and water yield. Such estimates can be problematic in any environment but are especially so in environments in which flat or complex topography makes delineations of mapped watershed boundaries difficult to discern. We added lithium bromide, (LiBr) to three small seepage lakes in the flat topography of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to provide an independent estimate of the water residence time. Water residence time [volume/(outflow + evaporation)] averaged 921 +/- 381 (SD) days among lakes and years and ranged from 400 to 1661 days at the extremes. This variation was not clearly related to year-to-year variation in precipitation, which was relatively constant [0.26 +/- 0.06 (SD) cm day (d)(-1)]. The addition of the tracer (along with measurements of lake volume) enabled us to estimate, independent from other hydrologic information, the flow of water leaving the lakes in seepage plus surface outflow. This value, in conjunction with measurement of precipitation and evaporation, enabled us to calculate complete water budgets for these lakes. Among lakes and years, the groundwater input averaged 0.48 +/- 0.36 cm d(-1) and accounted for 57% +/- 19% of total water input. This estimate was larger by 150% than that obtained by multiplying precipitation (minus estimated evapotranspiration) times a mapped value of the watershed areas. Our analysis enables us to calculate the relative significance of groundwater and precipitation for solutes such as phosphorus, hydrogen ion, and dissolved organic carbon.\",\"Inst Ecosyst Studies, Cary Arboretum, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA\",\"Cole, JJ (reprint author), Inst Ecosyst Studies, Cary Arboretum, Box AB, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA.\",,,\"Pace, Michael/0000-0001-5945-6131\",,,\"BENCALA KE, 1990, WATER RESOUR RES, V26, P989, DOI 10.1029/WR026i005p00989; Bird GA, 1995, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V52, P2276, DOI 10.1139/f95-818; CARACO NF, 1992, LIMNOL OCEANOGR, V37, P590, DOI 10.4319/lo.1992.37.3.0590; Carpenter S.

Natural resource managers and planners have to make challenging decisions within the complex and uncertain arena of climate change. Environmental decision support systems (EDSS) have been developed to assist stakeholders in effective decision making for the management of complex natural resource problems. EDSS which combine community engagement in developing future scenarios with computer-based land use planning and modeling tools are used internationally and reported to be effective. Yet, they are often not used after the research and development phase. To gain an understanding of the effectiveness of these tools, we interviewed the end users of an EDSS used in a climate change adaptation project in Canada and another in Australia. The end users of the tool are key informants, yet their perspective is lacking in the sustainability science literature. The findings show that neither EDSS was used after the projects ended. However, the majority of the end users in both projects valued the EDSS, confirming that the tools resulted in direct adaptation activities and influenced the thinking and work habits of the end users of the EDSS. We report on lessons learned from the two case studies and make recommendations regarding the processes and structures required to increase the effectiveness of the EDSS, its long-term use, and the legacy of learning that is embodied within it.\",\"[Reiter, Dana] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Meyer, Wayne] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Landscape Syst, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Parrott, Lael] Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth Environm & Geog Sci, Kelowna, BC, Canada; [Parrott, Lael] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC, Canada; [Baker, Douglas] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Grace, Peter] Queensland Univ Technol, Earth Environm & Biol Sci, Environm Syst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia\",\"Reiter, D (reprint author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.\",dana.reiter@hdr.qut.edu.au; wayne.meyer@adelaide.edu.au; lael.parrott@ubc.ca; d2.baker@qut.edu.au; pr.grace@qut.edu.au,,,,,,46.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,\"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY\",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

This technique uses enhanced biological P removal (EBPR) to concentrate P in sludge followed by chemical precipitation of P as struvite, a usable phosphate mineral. The present study models the feasibility of this enhanced removal and recovery technique in a WWTP in Arizona with design parameters typical of infrastructure in the United States. A mass balance was performed for existing treatment processes and modifications proposed to estimate the quantity of P that could be recovered under current and future flow conditions. Modeling results show that about 71 to 96% of the P being lost potentially could be recovered as struvite. About 491 +/- 64 t yr(-1) of struvite may be recovered after process modification, which corresponds to $150,000 +/- $ 20,000 yr(-1) in P sales to fertilizer industries. The process was projected to be economically feasible, with a payback period of 45 +/- 30 yr in the studied WWTP and a much shorter duration of 3 +/- 1 yr for WWTPs already using an EBPR process. Furthermore, modeling results suggest that P recovery can improve the quality of biosolids by favorably reducing the P: N ratio. Implementation of this strategy at US WWTPs may increase national security by reducing dependence of limited P resources. Considering all aspects of the recovery process with respect to environmental, economic, and social implications, the examined technique is concluded to represent a cost-attractive and sustainable method for P management in US WWTPs.\",\"[Venkatesan, Arjun K.; Hamdan, Abdul-Hakeem M.; Chavez, Vanessa M.; Brown, Jasmine D.; Halden, Rolf U.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Venkatesan, Arjun K.; Halden, Rolf U.] Arizona State Univ, Biodesign Inst, Ctr Environm Secur, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA\",\"Halden, RU (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.\",halden@asu.edu,\"Halden, Rolf/F-9562-2010\",\"Halden, Rolf/0000-0001-5232-7361\",,,,37.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,59.0,AMER SOC AGRONOMY,MADISON,\"677 S SEGOE RD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA\",0047-2425,1537-2537,,J ENVIRON QUAL,J.

By virtue of its capability to produce parts with complex geometry and functionally graded materials, AM has been introduced and used in multiple industrial sectors and is leading the way into the \"\"third industrial revolution\"\". One of the key considerations in Additively Manufactured Products (AMP) is the issue of sustainability which attracts increasing attention as modern society becomes more aware of environmental concerns. As a response to the growing requirement for sustainability, industries and customers are inclined to assess products and services through the perspective of life cycle sustainability. The integration of life cycle sustainability and AMP is still an open question and is the primary motivation for this study. Since the eventual goal of all advanced technologies is to serve and satisfy human society, social sustainability must be an essential part of all decisions regarding AMP. Limited studies that integrate social sustainability into AMP life cycle analysis is a current research gap in the body of the literature, and thus this paper will address it. The primary merit of this paper is developing a suitable full-dimension sustainability life cycle assessment framework to obtain a fundamental understanding of the performance of AMP life cycle sustainability. The proposed framework applies a more systemic AMP life span including AMP design, AM, usage, and end-of-life (EOL) handling. An AM produced gear is used as an example to illustrate the life cycle sustainability assessment framework. The results show that the AM stage has the highest influence on economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability and the EOL stage has the highest social impact. The results also indicate that AM mass production can significantly reduce the impact of sustainability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Facing this challenge, it is necessary to establish a sustainable information environment, including information policy, data quality regulations and information management framework to deal with the rapidly increasing environmental data and changing behavior related to data/information usage except upgrading the hardware and software devices. Taking the uniqueness and complexity of environmental data into account, this study proposes a systematic framework based on the principle of life cycle assessment to outline the elements and its associated guidance required for a sustainable information environment. Simultaneously, the concept of information ecology is also embedded into such a planning for the purpose of establishing a self-evolutional information environment.

In estuaries, a decline of overall habitat quality and functioning has led to significant efforts to restore critical ecosystem services, recently through the creation and restoration of oyster reefs. Oyster reef restoration generally occurs with goals of (1) increasing water quality via filtration through sustainable oyster recruitment, (2) stabilizing shorelines, and (3) creating and enhancing critical estuarine habitat for fish and invertebrates. We restored over 260 m(2) of oyster reef habitat in coastal Louisiana and followed the development and provision of these ecosystem services from 2009 through 2012. Oysters recruited to reefs immediately, with densities of oysters greater than 75 mm exceeding 80 ind m(-2) after 3 years, and provision of filtration rates of 1002 perpendicular to 187 L h(-1) m(-2); shoreline stabilization effects of the created reefs were minimal over the three years of monitoring, with some evidence of positive shoreline stabilization during higher wind/energy events only; increased nekton abundance of resident, but not larger transient fish was immediately measurable at the reefs, however, this failed to increase through time. Our results provide critical insights into the development trajectories of ecosystem services provided by restored oyster reefs, as well as the mechanisms mediating these changes. This is critical both ecologically to understand how and where a reef thrives, and for policy and management to guide decision-making related to oyster reef restoration and the crediting and accounting of ecosystem services.

This work developed a tiered life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) framework to fill this gap. The LCSA framework was defined with three tiers ranging from a streamline LCSA to temporally and spatially specific LCSA. The different specification in each tier includes the number and type of impact indicators and the demand for amount and quality of input data. The application of the tiered LCSA was demonstrated using survey data from an Irish dairy farm. The weighted overall sustainability score differed by tier because of the number of indicators and the data specification. The results of the study revealed the need to balance performance for environmental, economic, and social aspects of the farm. The tiered LCSA provides a framework for comparing the sustainability of dairy farms using the same valuation criteria, with the simple specification of Tier I providing entry level LCSA, and the more detail and comprehensive specification in Tier II and Tier III reducing the effect of uncertainty (due to data quality and number of indicators) on sustainability score, thus providing a more precise sustainability profile for a farm.

In particular, how a customer feels for the specific function of the product/service and how their needs have changed is a critical question. According to Kano model dynamics, customer requirements for certain functions change over time, because customers firstly feel attracted to the new service characteristics but come to take them for granted over time. However, previous research on proving this theory has relied on customer surveys and interviews, which are highly time-consuming and expensive. In response, this study suggests customer review-based analysis to investigate Kano model dynamics, because customer reviews can be considered to be excellent sources for reflecting customer needs. This study firstly categorizes customer reviews into two types-positive reviews and supplementation-required reviews-and suggests a five-section framework according to the frequency of each review type.

Unfortunately, these repositories still contain a limited number of chemicals. Furthermore, they are based on an attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) approach that considers fixed mass flows reflecting static industrial settings that are in practice dynamic, which might lead to errors. Building on some recent developments, we explore here an alternative approach to quantify the LCA impact of chemicals based on a network representation of the petrochemical industry coupled with linear programming, stochastic modeling and allocation methods. This method was applied to a network comprising 178 processes and 144 products, generating for most of the chemicals results that are consistent with those available in Ecoinvent for widely used impact categories such as GWP or those included in the ReCiPe 2008 methodology. The network model provides estimates of the life cycle impact embodied in chemicals under varying yields and demands, even for chemicals missing in standard repositories. Overall, we advocate for the use of network models of the petrochemical industry capable of carrying out consequential LCA under uncertainty as a complement to existing databases. This would allow to enlarge the capabilities of LCA repositories, thereby promoting the wider use of LCA in the chemical industry by improving the transparency and flexibility of the LCIA phase.\",\"[Calvo-Serrano, Raul; Guillen-Gosalbez, Gonzalo] Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, South Kensington Campus,Roderic Hill Bldg, London SW7 2BY, England\",\"Guillen-Gosalbez, G (reprint author), Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, South Kensington Campus,Roderic Hill Bldg, London SW7 2BY, England.\",g.guillen05@imperial.ac.uk,,,,,,65.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,\"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA\",2168-0485,,,ACS SUSTAIN CHEM ENG,ACS Sustain.

However, its increased global use is problematic for various reasons. This paper explores the challenges linked to increased AC use and discusses more sustainable alternatives. A literature review was conducted applying a transdisciplinary approach. It was further complemented by examples from cities in hot climates. To analyse the findings, an analytical framework was developed which considers four societal levels-individual, community, city, and national. The main challenges identified from the literature review are as follows: environmental, organisational, socio-economical, biophysical and behavioural. The paper also identifies several measures that could be taken to reduce the fast growth of AC use. However, due to the complex nature of the problem, there is no single solution to provide sustainable cooling. Alternative solutions were categorised in three broad categories: climate-sensitive urban planning and building design, alternative cooling technologies, and climate-sensitive attitudes and behaviour. The main findings concern the problems arising from leaving the responsibility to come up with cooling solutions entirely to the individual, and how different societal levels can work towards more sustainable cooling options. It is concluded that there is a need for a more holistic view both when it comes to combining various solutions as well as involving various levels in society.\",\"[Lundgren-Kownacki, Karin; Hornyanszky, Elisabeth Dalholm] Lund Univ, Dept Design Sci, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Chu, Tuan Anh] Lund Univ, Dept Architecture, Lund, Sweden; [Olsson, Johanna Alkan] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, Lund, Sweden; [Becker, Per] Lund Univ, Div Risk Management & Societal Safety, Lund, Sweden\",\"Lundgren-Kownacki, K (reprint author), Lund Univ, Dept Design Sci, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.\",karin.lundgren_kownacki@design.lth.se,,,Pufendorf Institute at Lund University,We are grateful to the Pufendorf Institute at Lund University for initiating and funding the HEAT Theme Project and all the researchers involved.,,120.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,\"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA\",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

In Mainland China, the practice of applying prefabrication technology in the construction industry still lags behind. In fact, the economic benefit is a key concern of various stake-holders involved in the construction process and is expected to influence the delivery of prefabricated buildings significantly. Therefore, this study established a cost benefit analysis framework to explore the basic cost composition of prefabrication and examined the effect of adopting prefabrication on the total cost of real building projects. Results show that the concrete and steel used in the typical prefabricated components were responsible for 26% to 60% of the total cost, followed by labor cost (17%-30%) and transportation (10%). The average incremental cost is highly linearly correlated with the prefabrication rate, which ranged from 237 yuan/m(2) to 437 yuan/m(2), in eight building projects. To fully gain the economic benefits from the precast construction, the future focus should lie in providing financial support for promoting the development of prefabrication technology, optimizing the structure integrity of prefabricated buildings, and improving the maturity of the precast market.

This situation threatens the livelihoods of smallholder dairy farmers. With varying success, farmers have tried to increase revenues by intensifying production through increased purchase of concentrates and production per cow, but this also resulted in substantial environmental problems. In this paper we combine a whole-farm model with data from representative pilot farms to explore alternative intensification options that more adequately can support the multi-objective setting of smallholders. Pilot dairy farms were defined in two categories: family based (FB) and semi-specialized (SS), each at three levels of intensification: extensive (E, <0.8 LU ha(-1)), medium-intensive (M, >0.8 and <12 LU ha(-1)), and intensive (I, >12 LU ha(-1)). We aimed to explore management alternatives that enhance farm economic performance, while improving resource use efficiency and reducing negative environmental impacts. For each of the six pilot farms a large set of Pareto-optimal farm configurations was generated using the whole farm model in combination with an evolutionary algorithm. Applying a multivariate analysis, the sets of alternatives were classified in three functional groups that respectively aimed to: a) maximize profitability ('economic'), b) maximize organic matter (OM) balance ('environmental'), and c) minimize labor used, N balance and feeding costs ('integrated'). Intensive (FBI, SSI) and large (SSM) farms had the widest ranges of opportunities for change, mainly to maximize profitability and/or OM balance, and to minimize N balance. Synergies were found between maximizing profitability and minimizing feed costs, and for minimizing both feed costs and N balance; trade-offs occurred for OM balance with feed costs and N balance. When comparing the current farm performance with-the sets of alternatives, farms performed already well in terms of N and labor balances, whereas the largest scope for improvement was found for increasing OM balances. The results showed that just re-allocating the current resources might by itself lead to economic, social and/or environmental improvements for smallholder dairy farms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

There has been an increased interest in rainwater harvesting (RWH) in both developing and developed nations. RWH can alleviate the effects of accelerated urbanisation and improve their water security in the face of uncertain future climate patterns. Australia's management of her millennium drought has proved the effectiveness of RWH systems. Success in Australia is promising for developing countries with inadequate water supply for drinking and sanitation and unreliable centralised water supply systems. However, there is little research on the economic analysis of RWH systems in developing countries. Here we have developed an economic analysis tool, called ERain, to combine daily performance analysis of RWH systems with life cycle cost analysis for use in economic evaluation. ERain has shown that the recent tendency towards smaller tanks in Australia is a poor choice economically, that RWH systems in Kenya can be economically beneficial if installed without reticulation, and that reliability (the percentage of days that the demand is met) can be a financial issue. ERain provides a realistic framework for establishing sustainable RWH solutions. The relationship between the benefit-cost ratio, reliability and efficiency (the percentage of available water used) is discussed as well as discrepancies between the benefit-cost ratio (BCR), and net present value (NPV) as economic indicators. Results highlight the need for innovation and reduction in capital and ongoing costs associated with RWH systems in preference to increasing the price of water to increase their economic viability. The impact of paying elevated prices for water purchased from street vendors on the other hand demonstrates the dependency of RWH system economic viability on regional freshwater cost. Results also show that a rebate that matches tank size would be a good initiative to encourage the installation of larger tanks and increase water security, while relying on customer perspective of value will tend towards installation of smaller tanks and a superficial water security.

Allometric relationships established ranked performance: small-sized individuals have higher mass-specific metabolic rates (photosynthesis, nutrient uptake and respiration) and sink more slowly than do individuals in the larger size-classes. No a priori form of niche diversification was considered. The simulation reproduced the seasonal pattern of the environmental variables and phytoplankton biomass, displayed seasonality in relative demography and sustained multi-year co-existence. Phytoplankton biomass rose during the spring bloom until nutrient depletion, decreasing afterwards due to zooplankton grazing. in the light-controlled phase of the spring bloom, the dominance ranking in the mixed layer was consistent with the allometric ranking of energetics; small, middle and large-sized phytoplankton accounted for 77.2%, 22.4% and 0.4% of total biomass (ca. 5 gC m(-2)). Vernal subduction. into the seasonal thermocline shaped a summer nutricline at ca. 30m depth, below which reproduction generated a deep chlorophyll maximum. During summer, zooplankton diel vertical migration, foraging and excretion, and microbial remineralisation of detritus produced a feeble and declining source of ammonium in the oligotrophic layer. Differential subduction into the seasonal thermocline and nutrient stress promoted the dominance of small phytoplankton in this layer. By the end of summer, the survivors of the three size-classes lay at different depths, which provides a mechanism to relax competition: small cells survived in the mixed layer, the middle-sized in the seasonal thermocline, and the largest in both the seasonal and permanent thermoclines. Large phytoplankton survived longer in the eutrophic but poorly lit environment due to their lower mass-specific respiration. Oligotrophy lasted until the mixed layer reached the nutricline in autumn. Those cells in the seasonal and permanent thermoclines were entrained into the mixed layer as it deepened, seeding the growing season next year. The numbers of plankton in the three seed populations depended critically on their reproduction during summer. In winter, growth was accelerated by the re-establishment of the diurnal thermocline. From year-to-year, the relative demographic success (the annual competitive advantage, ACA) of the competing populations depends critically of their relative energetics and the biomasses in the seed populations. Taken together, these two factors yielded negligible ranking among the size-classes, and thus co-existence was achieved over three simulated years despite substantial seasonal variation in competitive advantage.

To further the understanding of these processes, column experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of biomass growth on decane or naphthalene dissolved in simulated groundwater on the hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity of sand. The effect of grain size, groundwater flowrate, and nitrogen limitation were investigated. Given the low carbon loading resulting from the solubility of decane and naphthalene, sparse and discontinuous biomass growth reduced the hydraulic conductivity of the sand by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude after 35 to 63 days. This biogrowth initially increased dispersivity of the sand, but after longer periods of growth dispersivity, decreased to stable values near that of the clean sand. The results indicate that biogrowth can have significant effects in natural systems with low carbon loading and nitrogen availability, and should be taken into account when using models to predict contaminant transport in the field.\",\"Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Arch Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Camille Buehler Consulting, Susanville, CA 96130 USA; Colorado Sch Mines, Golden, CO 80401 USA\",\"Bielefeldt, AR (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Arch Engn, Campus Box 428, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.\",,,\"BIELEFELDT, ANGELA/0000-0002-7846-9699\",,,,23.0,19.0,19.0,1.0,12.0,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,\"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA\",0733-9372,,,J ENVIRON ENG-ASCE,J.

Previous research on gender issues has focused primarily on biological biomedical factors over psychological and social factors. In this study we compare subjective and objective quality of life in adults persons with epilepsy to persons without epilepsy by gender using the biopsychosocial model in the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), a large epidemiological survey that covers 98% of the Canadian population. Logistic regression analyses were conducted using self-rated health status and the Health Utility Index (R) 3 (HUI3) as the outcomes. Quality of life was significantly moderated after controlling for the biological biomedical variables in all analyses except the HUI3. Males with epilepsy were more likely to have HUI3 scores of 0.70 or greater than males without epilepsy (OR=1.61, 95%CI 1.32-1.96). For males with epilepsy the HUI3 was further moderated, but remained significantly better in the final model that controlled for biological, psychological and social factors (OR=1.43, 95%CI 1.17-1.76). Our findings provide support for treatment approaches that focus on the whole person. Such approaches should take into account gender differences when examining objective quality of life.

In the health realm, a true SDG approach will require a five-fold paradigm shift according to Buse and Hawkes. This article explores whether early traces of this paradigm shift can already be witnessed in the Indian context, focusing on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) more in particular. Discussion: By now, NCDs make up a large health burden in India, both individually and on the health system. Inspired by an SDG vision, tackling NCDs will require a comprehensive approach rooted in preventive, curative and rehabilitative services. In India, some early momentum in this respect can already be witnessed, certainly in addressing the first two challenges identified by Buse and Hawkes, leadership and intersectoral coherence, and a shift from treatment to prevention. A central plan addressing health through an inter-sectoral approach has shaped the trajectory so far, moving away from silos to engagement with sectors beyond health. New guidelines addressing comprehensive primary healthcare propose a community outreach and preventive approach for NCDs. At a broader level, NCD prevention is also closely linked to tackling the so called \"\"commercial determinants of health\"\" and will require among others strong (central and state level) regulation, teaming up with global advocacy networks and capitalizing on global frameworks, where they exist. Strong political leadership will be indispensable for this, and is according to Buse and Hawkes closely linked to seeing health as a right and the government as accountable when it comes to providing for the right to health through its policies and actions. Conclusion: National stewardship will thus be key, via a more adaptive network governance structure with the central level coordinating with the state level to ensure implementation, while also engaging with other stakeholders, sectors, the private sector and civil society. As one can expect, networked governance, necessary for the battle against NCDs, is a work in progress in India. In sum, some of the early (paradigm shift) signs are encouraging, but by and large it is still too early to assess whether a real paradigm shift has taken place.\",\"[Mondal, Shinjini] McGill Univ, Dept Family Med, 5858 Ch Cote Neiges, Montreal, PQ H3S 1Z1, Canada; [Van Belle, Sara] Inst Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth, Hlth Policy Unit, Natl Str 155, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium\",\"Mondal, S (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Family Med, 5858 Ch Cote Neiges, Montreal, PQ H3S 1Z1, Canada.\",shinjini.mondal@mail.mcgill.ca,,,\"Canadian Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Scholarships (CTC-QES); Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium\",\"Shinjini Mondal is supported by The Canadian Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Scholarships (CTC-QES).

The quantitative details of how these multiple nutrient cycles intersect is determined by phytoplankton stoichiometry. Here we review some classic work and recent advances on the determinants of phytoplankton stoichiometry and their role in determining ecosystem stoichiometry. First, we use a model of growth with flexible stoichiometry to reexamine Rhee and Goldman's classic chemostat data. We also discuss a recent data compilation by Hall and colleagues that illustrates some limits to phytoplankton flexibility, and a model of physiological adaptation that can account for these results. Second, we use a model of resource allocation to determine the how the optimal nitrogen-to-phosphorus stoichiometry depends on the ecological conditions under which species grow and compete. Third, we discuss Redfield's mechanism for the homeostasis of the oceans' nitrogen-to-phosphorus stoichiometry and show its robustness to additional factors such as iron-limitation and temporal fluctuations. Finally, we suggest areas for future research.\",\"[Klausmeier, C.

A case study with CHWs within Kenya\",GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,community health workers; medical supervision; clinical referral; close-to-community,,\"Background: Community health workers (CHWs) are used increasingly in the world to address shortages of health workers and the lack of a pervasive national health system. However, while their role is often described at a policy level, it is not clear how these ideals are instantiated in practice, how best to support this work, or how the work is interpreted by local actors. CHWs are often spoken about or spoken for, but there is little evidence of CHWs' own characterisation of their practice, which raises questions for global health advocates regarding power and participation in CHW programmes. This paper addresses this issue. Design: A case study approach was undertaken in a series of four steps. Firstly, groups of CHWs from two communities met and reported what their daily work consisted of. Secondly, individual CHWs were interviewed so that they could provide fuller, more detailed accounts of their work and experiences; in addition, community health extension workers and community health committee members were interviewed, to provide alternative perspectives. Thirdly, notes and observations were taken in community meetings and monthly meetings. The data were then analysed thematically, creating an account of how CHWs describe their own work, and the tensions and challenges that they face. Results: The thematic analysis of the interview data explored the structure of CHW's work, in terms of the frequency and range of visits, activities undertaken during visits (monitoring, referral, etc.) and the wider context of their work (links to the community and health service, limited training, coordination and mutual support through action and discussion days, etc.), and provided an opportunity for CHWs to explain their motivations, concerns and how they understood their role. The importance of these findings as a contribution to the field is evidenced by the depth and detail of their descriptive power. One important aspect of this is that CHWs' accounts of both successes and challenges involved material elements: leaky tins and dishracks evidenced successful health interventions, whilst bicycles, empty first aid kits and recruiting stretcher bearers evidenced the difficulties of resourcing and geography they are required to overcome. Conclusion: The way that these CHWs described their work was as healthcare generalists, working to serve their community and to integrate it with the official health system. Their work involves referrals, monitoring, reporting and educational interactions. Whilst they face problems with resources and training, their accounts show that they respond to this in creative ways, working within established systems of community power and formal authority to achieve their goals, rather than falling into a 'deficit' position that requires remedial external intervention. Their work is widely appreciated, although some households do resist their interventions, and figures of authority sometimes question their manner and expertise. The material challenges that they face have both practical and community aspects, since coping with scarcity brings community members together. The implication of this is that programmes co-designed with CHWs will be easier to implement because of their relevance to their practices and experiences, whereas those that assume a deficit model or seek to use CHWs as an instrument to implement external priorities are likely to disrupt their work.\",\"[Oliver, Martin] Univ London, Inst Educ, London Knowledge Lab, London WC1N 3QS, England; [Geniets, Anne; Winters, Niall] Univ Oxford, Dept Educ, Oxford, England; [Rega, Isabella] Bournemouth Univ, Media Sch, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England; [Mbae, Simon M.] Amref Hlth Africa, Nairobi, Kenya\",\"Oliver, M (reprint author), Univ London, Inst Educ, London Knowledge Lab, 23-29 Emerald St, London WC1N 3QS, England.\",m.oliver@ioe.ac.uk,,\"Mbae, Simon/0000-0002-3863-1970; Rega, Isabella/0000-0002-9149-8531\",UK's Economic and Social Research Council; Department for International Development under the ESRC-DFID Joint Scheme for Research on International Development [ES/J018619/1],\"The work reported in this paper was funded through the UK's Economic and Social Research Council and Department for International Development, under the ESRC-DFID Joint Scheme for Research on International Development, ref.

Using community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches and undergirded by both the Socio-ecological Theory and the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change, the 18-month intervention was developed in six north Florida churches, randomly assigned as treatment or comparison. The intervention was framed around three conceptual components: awareness building (individual knowledge development); clinical learning (individual and small group educational sessions); and efficacy development (recognition and sustainability). We identified three lessons learned: providing consistency in programming even during participant absences; providing structured activities to assist health ministries in sustainability; and addressing changes at the church level. Recommendations include church-based approaches that reflect multi-level CBPR and the collaborative faith model.\",\"[Ralston, Penny A.; Young-Clark, Iris] Florida State Univ, Ctr Better Hlth & Life Underserved Populat, C2200 Univ Ctr, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Coccia, Catherine] Florida Int Univ, Dept Dietet & Nutr, Miami, FL 33199 USA\",\"Ralston, PA (reprint author), Florida State Univ, Ctr Better Hlth & Life Underserved Populat, C2200 Univ Ctr, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\",pralston@fsu.edu,,,National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) [R24MD002807],This project was supported by Award Number R24MD002807 (P.I.

Here, I study the importance of subnational commodity flows in life cycle inventory results of US products. Two models are used for analysis, an aggregate input-output model covering all productive sectors and a detailed process model focusing on corn. On average, similar to 50% of agricultural, mining, and manufacturing goods traveled across state boundaries (10-50% for corn specifically). Neglecting the inter-state commodity flows can lead to large errors in state-level life cycle inventory results (up to 200-400%). It can also affect national average inventory results: depending on where corn is sourced from, an average unit of corn used as feed and feedstock in the US could have substantially different amounts of embodied water. Results further suggest that the more spatially variable of an environmental stressor, water use the more important it is to account for commodity flows. A better understanding of interregional commodity flows at subnational levels improves the predictive capability of life cycle models for better policy support.\",\"[Yang, Yi] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA\",\"Yang, Y (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.\",yang1385@umn.edu,,,,,,50.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,\"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND\",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018.0,118,,,,,,312,316,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.024,,,,5.0,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,WOS:000435050000029,,,,,2018-09-20\n",

Nevertheless, although yielding relatively low amounts of water, dew can be of great importance for the local water balance in semiarid and and environments. The aim of this study was to explore the adequacy of the Eddy Covariance technique, combined with quatitative methods (such as wetness sensors), as a tool to measure actual dew in semiarid conditions. This technique was used to assess the relative contribution of dew to the local water balance in a dry river bed representative of semiarid environments (Rambla Honda, Tabernas) located in the Almeria province (SE Spain). Results show that an accurate filtering and management of data from Eddy Covariance (EC) combined with the records of the wetness sensors (WS), allowed us to generate a data base which can be used to develop and parameterize theoretical or empirical dew deposition models. We found that a simple equation for potential dew predicted adequately actual dew for the study area, and permitted us to estimate a dew contribution of 13 mm from February to June 2003, which accounts for 12% of the rainfall. for the same period. Dew deposition was higher in late winter and early spring, when vegetation starts to grow actively. In consequence, this additional input of water can be of great relevance to the local water balance especially during dry years. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Establishing a rational strategy for redeveloping brownfields is an unambiguously complex task that requires considering a number of different economic, social, physical and environmental factors. The strategic decision-making has a long term impact on the quality of life, ecological balance and urban structure. Therefore, the paper is aimed at developing a comprehensive set of criteria that contribute to the redevelopment of brownfield land in urban areas. It focuses on six main development strategies that embrace creating residential, green, commercial, recreational activity and industrial areas or leaving land as a reserve. Geographic information system (GIS) tools are employed to collect the spatial information, obtain the initial set of criteria and derive the statistical data. Expert's evaluations along with a statistical method of gauging the level of concordance of their opinion combined with Delphi method are used for determining significance of criteria within economic, social, physical (urbanistic) and environmental criteria groups. This study establishes the most significant criteria for implementing different scenarios of the brownfield land redevelopment in Vilnius, Lithuania. Developed framework will support the decision-making process in the brownfield land redevelopment aiding a sustainable urban planning.\",\"[Burinskiene, Marija; Bielinskas, Vytautas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Urban Engn, Sauletekio Ave 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Podviezko, Askoldas] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Inst Econ, Ateities G 20, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Maliene, Vida] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Fac Engn & Technol, Dept Built Environm, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England; [Gurskiene, Virginija; Maliene, Vida] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Land Management & Geomat, Fac Water & Land Management, Studentu 11, LT-53361 Kaunas, Lithuania\",\"Burinskiene, M (reprint author), Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Urban Engn, Sauletekio Ave 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.; Maliene, V (reprint author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Fac Engn & Technol, Dept Built Environm, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England.; Maliene, V (reprint author), Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Land Management & Geomat, Fac Water & Land Management, Studentu 11, LT-53361 Kaunas, Lithuania.\",marija.burinskiene@vgtu.lt; vytautas.bielinskas@vgtu.lt; askoldas@gmail.com; virginija.gurskiene@asu.lt; v.maliene@ljmu.ac.uk,,\"Maliene, Vida/0000-0001-8271-4450; Podviezko, Askoldas/0000-0002-0394-1645\",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU),We thank Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) for funding publication fees.,,67.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,27.0,MDPI AG,BASEL,\"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND\",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2017.0,9,5,,,,,,,759,10.3390/su9050759,,,,17.0,GREEN & SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EY6XN,WOS:000404127800084,,gold,,,2018-07-06\n",

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are important tools to achieve local and global marine conservation targets. Marine ecosystems generate goods and services vital for human well-being. Their value can be explored not only from an economic viewpoint based on market and human preferences, but also using a biophysical perspective based on the accounting of environmental costs sustained for the generation of natural capital stocks and ecosystem services flows. In this study, the value of natural capital in the MPA \"\"the Islands of Ventotene and S. Stefano\"\" (Central Italy) was assessed applying a biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model based on emergy accounting. The value of natural capital was estimated for the main habitats of the investigated MPA in terms of the work done by the biosphere for its generation and maintenance. Both the autotrophic and heterotrophic natural capital of the MPA was evaluated. The highest value of emergy density of 4.26.10(11) sej m(-2) was shown by the habitat \"\"Posidonia oceanica seagrass bed\"\" when investigating the autotrophic natural capital. The sciaphilic hard bottom habitat (coralligenous) showed the highest value of emergy density of 2.76.10(12) sej m(-2) when investigating the heterotrophic natural capital. The high emergy cost of coralligenous confirmed the importance of this habitat that represents one of the most important hot spot of species diversity in the Mediterranean Sea. The total emergy value of natural capital of the MPA was converted to monetary units by using the emergy-to-money ratio for Italy, resulting in 8.26 M(sic) Finally, a GIS tool was used to show the spatial distribution of natural capital values in relation to different habitats. The outcomes of this study highlighted the usefulness of the applied biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model to explore the ecological value of natural capital in marine ecosystems while supporting local managers and policy makers for the sustainable development of MPAs.

The major international treaties to address ecosystem protection lack meaningful binding obligations and the requisite financial instruments to affect large-scale conservation. The Kyoto Protocol's emissions-trading framework creates economic incentives for nations to reduce greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions cost effectively. Incorporating GHG impacts from land-use activities into this system would create a market for an important ecosystem service provided by forests and agricultural lands: sequestration of atmospheric carbon. This would spur conservation efforts while reducing the 20% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions produced by land-use change, particularly tropical deforestation. The Kyoto negotiations surrounding land-use activities have been hampered by a lack of robust carbon inventory data. Moreover, the Protocol's provisions agreed to in Kyoto made it difficult to incorporate carbon-sequestering land-use activities into the emissions-trading framework without undermining the atmospheric GHG reductions contemplated in the treaty. Subsequent negotiations since 1997 failed to produce a crediting system that provides meaningful incentives for enhanced carbon sequestration. Notably, credit for reducing rates of tropical deforestation was explicitly excluded from the Protocol. Ultimately, an effective GHG emissions-trading framework will require full carbon accounting for all emissions and sequestration from terrestrial ecosystems. Improved inventory systems and capacity building for developing nations will, therefore, be necessary.\",\"Environm Def, Washington, DC 20009 USA\",\"Bonnie, R (reprint author), Environm Def, 1875 Connecticut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20009 USA.\",,,,,,,21.0,12.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,ROYAL SOC LONDON,LONDON,\"6 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND\",1364-503X,,,PHILOS T ROY SOC A,Philos.

The aim of this study is to assess the actual trend of atmospheric pollution in a study area, assuming that all heating systems are replaced by small size biomass boilers linked to the buildings through district heating network. Ground level concentrations of particulate matter, emitted by different heating systems, are therefore evaluated through numerical simulations performed by means of an atmospheric dispersion model (Sirane). As a first step, we have compared the environmental impact of a woodchip boilers network with that given by the use of traditional heating systems, i.e. wood stoves and natural gas boilers. As a second step, we have analysed the impact of such a network taking into account different emission scenarios, related to different boilers operating conditions. Results show that the environmental performances of a woodchip boilers network can be optimized by combining it with other renewable sources of energy devoted to the supply of hot water. The adopted analysis methodology can be applied to other real or hypothetic punctual sources on the territory.\",\"[Pognant, Federica; Bo, Matteo; Clerico, Marina] Politecn Torino, DIATI, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Chi Vuong Nguyen; Salizzoni, Pietro] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon I, Univ Lyon, Ecole Cent Lyon, Lab Mecan Fluides & Acoust,UMR CNRS 5509,INSA Lyo, 36 Ave Guy Collongue, F-69134 Ecully, France\",\"Pognant, F (reprint author), Politecn Torino, DIATI, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.\",federica.pognant@polito.it,,\"BO, MATTEO/0000-0002-8927-4950\",,,,33.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,6.0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,\"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS\",1420-2026,1573-2967,,ENVIRON MODEL ASSESS,Environ.

In response to multiple stressors, coral reef health has declined in recent decades, with reefs exhibiting reduced living coral and structural complexity, and a concomitant rise in the dominance of algal resources. Reef degradation alters food availability and reduces the diversity and density of refuges for prey. These changes affect predator-prey interactions and can have cascading impacts on food webs and fisheries productivity. 2. We use a size-based ecosystem model of coral reefs that incorporates the - influence of structural complexity, benthic primary production and detrital recycling to - explore how predator-prey interactions and fisheries productivity respond to a gradient of reef degradation. 3. We show that fisheries productivity overall may be robust to initial stages of reef degradation because the benefits of increased resources outweigh the costs of moderate refuge decline. However, the assemblage composition and size structure of reef fish will differ on degraded reefs, with herbivores and invertivores contributing relatively more to productivity. 4. More significant losses of refuges associated with the erosion of structural complexity correspond to fisheries productivity losses of at least 35% compared to healthy reefs. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our model provides fisheries managers with quantitative predictions about how fisheries productivity may change in response to the ongoing degradation of coral reefs. We predict an initial increase in productivity at intermediate reef degradation, followed by a drastic decline when structural complexity is lost. We also capture subtle changes to potential catch composition and fish size, including increases in smaller herbivorous and invertivorous fish from degraded reefs, which will undoubtedly impact fisheries value. On the one hand, our results reassure for continued productivity in the short term, but on the other, we warn against complacency. Management must change to capture any potential benefits to fisheries, and long-term sustainability still depends on the maintenance of complex coral reef habitats.\",\"[Rogers, Alice] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Goddard Bldg, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Blanchard, Julia L.] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Mumby, Peter J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Australian Res Council,Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Goddard Bldg, Brisbane, Qld, Australia\",\"Rogers, A (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Goddard Bldg, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.; Mumby, PJ (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Australian Res Council,Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Goddard Bldg, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.\",a.rogers2@uq.edu.au; p.j.mumby@uq.edu.au,,\"Blanchard, Julia/0000-0003-0532-4824\",World Bank Group; Global Environment Facility,World Bank Group; Global Environment Facility,,48.0,1.0,1.0,29.0,29.0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,\"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA\",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Two known models of benefits provision dominate the ethical discourse of research in developing countries. The first model, known as the reasonable availability, endorses the obligation to provide interventions proven to be effective at the end of a study. This contrasts with the second model, known as fair benefits, which endorses other forms of benefits that host communities may deem as fair beyond those derived directly from the study's findings. This paper explores a third benefit model consistent with the writings of the Human Hereditary and Health in Africa (H3Africa) research initiative. The H3Africaa North-South collaborative initiative predicated by U.S. National Institutes of Health, the Wellcome Trust and the African Society of Human Genetics upholds a benefit model that endorses capacity building as the primary obligation of its research agenda. This is evident by the endorsement of mechanisms to strengthen capacity building in its research projects. While capacity building remains a plausible means of improving the expertise, quality and independence of research in Africa, sustainable measures are needed to realizing the full potential for African-led research on the continent.\",\"[Dauda, Bege] Univ Penn, Dept Med Eth & Hlth Policy, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Joffe, Steven] Univ Penn, Med Eth & Hlth Policy, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Joffe, Steven] Univ Penn, Div Med Eth, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Joffe, Steven] Univ Penn, Pediat, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA\",\"Joffe, S (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Med Eth & Hlth Policy, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.\",joffes@upenn.edu,,\"Joffe, Steven/0000-0002-0667-7384\",\"Advanced Bioethics at the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy, University of Pennsylvania\",\"This work represents the research output of the postdoctoral scholarship in Advanced Bioethics at the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy, University of Pennsylvania.\",,30.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,\"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA\",1471-8731,1471-8847,,DEV WORLD BIOETH,Dev.

The sustainable management of the remaining peatland necessitates an action plan including the evidence by which to evaluate choices. It also requires an articulation of a vision for peatland in the decades to come. In this respect, peatlands are an environmental asset, but also a social and economic resource.

This article describes the BEATS Study design, the establishment of research and community collaborations, planning and preparation for data collection, study implementation and dissemination activities and selected preliminary findings. The BEATS Study is founded on a multidisciplinary approach and multi-sector collaborations between secondary schools, the city council, the local communities, and academia. The study uses a mixed-method approach incorporating both quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus groups/interviews) approaches with students, parents, teachers and school principals. All 12 secondary schools in Dunedin, New Zealand, are participating in the study. As of September 2014, 1,272 adolescents from nine schools (age: 15.3 +/- 1.4 years; 46.6% boys) completed the student survey. Three additional schools will be surveyed in 2015. On average, 33.0% of Dunedin adolescents use ATS. ATS rates vary greatly by school (range: 8.6% to 46.5%) and most students like the way how they travel to school (88.3%). With 100% school recruitment rate, this study provides a unique sample of students and parents across one city with a heterogeneous physical environment. The findings will enable community health promoters, policy makers and city planners to address ATS barriers, encourage active transport and create supportive built environments to promote ATS.\",\"[Mandic, Sandra; Mountfort, Ashley; Hopkins, Debbie; Williams, John; Brook, Emily; Moore, Antoni] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Flaherty, Charlotte] Dunedin City Council, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Wilson, Gordon] Dunedin Secondary Sch Partnership, Dunedin, New Zealand\",\"Mandic, S (reprint author), Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.\",sandra.mandic@otago.ac.nz,,,,,,24.0,10.0,10.0,1.0,11.0,FEDERACION ESPANOLA ASOC DOCENTES EDUCACION FISICA-FEADEF,MURCIA,\"C CABO VIDIO 27, SAN JAVIER, MURCIA, 30730, SPAIN\",1579-1726,1988-2041,,RETOS,Retos,,2015.0,,28,,,,,197,202,,,,,,6.0,\"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism\",Social Sciences - Other Topics,CT1EL,WOS:000362540000034,,gold,,,2018-07-03\n",

This gap in the literature is addressed via the 2012 nationally representative Canadian Community Health Survey (n = 21,744). The prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts among those with an SLD was much higher than those without (11.1% vs. 2.7%, p < .001). In comparison with their peers without SLDs, adults with SLDs had 46% higher odds of having ever attempted suicide, even after adjusting for most known risk factors (e.g., childhood adversities, history of mental illness and substance abuse, sociodemographics; odds ratio = 1.46, 95% CI [1.05, 2.04]). The largest attenuation in the association between SLD and suicidal attempts was accounted for by adverse childhood experiences.

A systematic review was conducted to determine the extent of equity of CHW programmes and to identify intervention design factors which influence equity of health outcomes. Methods: In accordance with our published protocol, we systematically searched eight databases from 2004 to 2014 for quantitative and qualitative studies which assessed access, utilisation, quality or community empowerment following introduction of a CHW programme according to equity stratifiers (place of residence, gender, socio-economic position and disability). Thirty four papers met inclusion criteria. A thematic framework was applied and data extracted and managed, prior to charting and thematic analysis. Results: To our knowledge this is the first systematic review that describes the extent of equity within CHW programmes and identifies CHW intervention design features which influence equity. CHW programmes were found to promote equity of access and utilisation for community health by reducing inequities relating to place of residence, gender, education and socio-economic position. CHWs can also contribute towards more equitable uptake of referrals at health facility level. There was no clear evidence for equitable quality of services provided by CHWs and limited information regarding the role of the CHW in generating community empowerment to respond to social determinants of health. Factors promoting greater equity of CHW services include recruitment of most poor community members as CHWs, close proximity of services to households, pre-existing social relationship with CHW, provision of home-based services, free service delivery, targeting of poor households, strengthened referral to facility, sensitisation and mobilisation of community. However, if CHW programmes are not well planned some of the barriers faced by clients at health facility level can replicate at community level. Conclusions: CHWs promote equitable access to health promotion, disease prevention and use of curative services at household level. However, care must be taken by policymakers and implementers to take into account factors which can influence the equity of services during planning and implementation of CHW programmes.\",\"[McCollum, Rosalind; Gomez, Woedem; Theobald, Sally; Taegtmeyer, Miriam] Univ Liverpool Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Pembroke Pl, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England\",\"McCollum, R (reprint author), Univ Liverpool Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Pembroke Pl, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England.\",r.mccollum@liverpool.ac.uk,,,European Union [306090],\"The research leading to these results was conducted in collaboration with the REACHOUT consortium and has received co-funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme ([FP7/2007-2013] [FP7/2007-2011]) under grant agreement number 306090.

However, our understanding of the association between immunity and fitness in nature remains limited due to both the complexity of the vertebrate immune system and the often-limited availability of immune reagents in nonmodel organisms. Here, we use methods and reagents developed by veterinary researchers for domestic ungulates on blood samples collected from a wild Soay sheep population, to evaluate an unusually broad panel of immune parameters. Our evaluation included different innate and acquired immune cell types as well as nematode parasite-specific antibodies of different isotypes. We test how these markers correlate with one another, how they vary with age-group and sex, and, crucially, whether they predict over-winter survival either within or among demographic groups. We found anticipated patterns of variation in markers with age, associated with immune development, and once these age trends were accounted for, correlations among our 11 immune markers were generally weak. We found that females had higher proportions of naive T cells and gamma-delta T cells than males, independent of age, while our other markers did not differ between sexes. Only one of our 11 markers predicted overwinter survival: sheep with higher plasma levels of anti-nematode IgG antibodies were significantly more likely to survive the subsequent high mortality winter, independent of age, sex, or weight. This supports a previous finding from this study system using a different set of samples and shows that circulating antibody levels against ecologically relevant parasites in natural systems represent an important parameter of immune function and may be under strong natural selection. Our data provide rare insights into patterns of variation among age-and sex groups in different T-cell subsets and antibody levels in the wild, and suggest that certain types of immune response-notably those likely to be repeatable within individuals and linked to resistance to ecologically relevant parasites-may be most informative for research into the links between immunity and fitness under natural conditions.\",\"[Watson, Rebecca L.; Watt, Kathryn A.; Pemberton, Josephine M.; Pilkington, Jill G.; Waterfall, Martin; Hopper, Phoebe R.

Then, the model was validated in China's building sector based on the data collected from 30 provinces during 2007-2015. The key findings show that: (1) the increased final energy consumption in the building industry accounted for 53.3% of that in China. (2) Building material production contributed the most (69.2%) to the energy changes, followed by building operation (29.6%) and construction (1.2%). (3) The change of TEC was attributed the most to the area effect (90.4%) and the energy intensity effect (42.4%). (4) Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hebei, Fujian and Shandong contributed the most (47%) to the increase of China's building energy use. These findings provide an insightful understanding of the building energy changes and also a quantifiable justification for making building-specific energy policies, which are discussed at the end of the study.

For many crop-based products, the agricultural production step shows substantial impacts in LCA results. Using the illustrative case of cereal production in Wallonia, Belgium, the study uses sensitivity analyses to explore the parameters to be adjusted in priority when conducting a local LCA for crop production, taking into account uncertainties tied to input and output inventory data and impact characterization factors. Methods The analysis investigated local specificities in the production of eight cereal crops in Wallonia. Cropping systems were modeled according to accounting data from representative farms, including areas, yields, inputs, and machinery. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses for input parameters and methodological choices were performed. The following parameters were evaluated: the influence of the functional unit (kg, ha, (sic)), the link between yield and LCIA results, the relevance of using up-to-date data for mineral fertilizer production, the type of mineral fertilizer, the model for direct field emission calculation, and the allocation rules. Results and discussion We observed that the use of several functional units embracing the multifunctional role of agriculture enables identifying crops with low impacts per kilogram, hectare, and euro at the same time. The cereal production steps with the greatest impact were mineral fertilizer production (up to 84% of the total impact, depending on crop and impact category) and emissions from the application of mineral (up to 65%) and organic (up to 94%) fertilizers. Sensitive parameters to be adjusted in priority were identified. Despite the high correlation between yield and results, simply extrapolating impacts on the basis of yield seemed mostly inappropriate. Using updated data for mineral fertilizer production reduced impacts by 6-160%. Shifting models for field emission calculation influenced acidification and eutro-phication by 5-142%. Hypotheses on allocation factors affected results by 10-26%. Conclusions and recommendations An LCA for the production of major Walloon cereals was conducted taking into account local cropping practices and yields. The parameters relevant for conducting a regional LCA of crop production were identified and discussed in comparison with generic data and models. As LCA is an iterative process, further improvements would include the use of more specific models for direct field emission calculation. The results could serve as a reference for products using Walloon cereals and help enhance the quality of LCAs conducted for these products.\",\"[Van Stappen, Florence] Walloon Agr Res Ctr CRA W, Biomass Bioprod & Energy Unit, 146 Chaussee Namur, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; [Mathot, Michael; Loriers, Astrid; Delcour, Alice; Stilmant, Didier; Planchon, Viviane] CRA W, Farming Syst Terr & Informat Technol Unit, 100 Rue Serpont, B-6800 Libramont, Belgium; [Delcour, Alice; Goffart, Jean-Pierre] CRA W, Crop Prod Syst Unit, 4 Rue Bordia, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; [Bodson, Bernard] Univ Liege ULg GbxABT, Crop Sci, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, 2 Passage Deportes, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; [Leonard, Angelique] Univ Liege, Dept Chem Engn, Batiment B6c Sart Tilman, B-4000 Liege, Belgium\",\"Van Stappen, F (reprint author), Walloon Agr Res Ctr CRA W, Biomass Bioprod & Energy Unit, 146 Chaussee Namur, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium.\",f.vanstappen@cra.wallonie.be,,,Walloon Agricultural Research Centre (CRA-W),\"The authors wish to thank the Walloon Agricultural Research Centre (CRA-W), which finances this research.

In Sri Lanka, the apparel sector is the key foreign revenue earner, and developing a sustainable apparel industry will provide a competitive and strategic advantage to the Sri Lankan apparel products in the global market. However, limited data availability and a lack of studies carried out to quantify environmental impacts and propose mitigation strategies have detrimentally affected the growth of the Sri Lankan apparel industry. This study proposes a framework to quantify the environmental impacts due to energy use in garment production in the Sri Lankan apparel industry. Initially, the impacts were quantified using life cycle assessment with a gate-to-gate approach, based on the specific energy use and energy sources being used in the major production and transportation phases in a garment's life cycle. A case study was then conducted based on the data from an apparel production facility located in Sri Lanka. The life cycle impacts of energy use of the selected process phases were compared to identify the most critical processes in terms of the environmental footprint. Finally, the study was extended to investigate the effects of using different alternative energy supply scenarios. The life cycle impact assessment was conducted using the ReCiPe (Ver 1.11) Midpoint method in SimaPro. The findings revealed that the garment production phase carries the highest life cycle impacts among the studied process phases from fabric manufacture to distribution to the end market. Scenario analysis showed that the use of solar photovoltaics and biomass to supply the required electricity and thermal energy for apparel manufacturing can reduce climate change, ozone depletion, and terrestrial acidification by 90-95%. This information can be used by decision makers to plan for sustainability and growth of the apparel industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\",\"[Muthukumarana, T.

Open-access conditions and the public nature of many services increase the difficulty in resolving these conflicts. \"\"Sustainability\"\" is a vague but widely accepted guideline for finding reasonable trade-offs between different interests. The UN view of sustainable development suggests that coastal zone management should aim at a sustainable ecological, economic, and social-cultural development. Looking closer at economic sustainability, it is observed that economic analyses about whether changes in society imply a gain or a loss should take into account the economic value of the environment. Methods used for making such economic valuation in the context of the Swedish coastal zone are briefly reviewed. It is noted that the property rights context matters for the results of a valuation study. This general background is followed by a concise presentation of the design and results of four valuation studies on Swedish coastal zone issues.

The economic climate limits governments' fiscal capacity to continue to devote an increasing share of public funds to health care. Meanwhile the demands for health care within populations continue to increase. Planning the future requirements for health care is typically based on applying current levels of health service use by age to demographic projections of the population. But changes in age-specific levels of health over time would undermine this 'constant use by age' assumption. We use representative Canadian survey data (Canadian Community Health Survey) covering the period 2001-2012, to identify the separate trends in demography (population ageing) and epidemiology (population health) on self-reported health. We propose an approach to estimating future health care requirements that incorporates cohort trends in health. Overall health care requirements for the population increase as the size and mean age of the population increase, but these effects are mitigated by cohort trends in health we find the estimated need for health care is lower when models account for cohort effects in addition to age effects.

However, according to our experience for many stakeholders and decision-makers in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, the principles for sustainability defined by the Bruntland Commission are far too abstract. They are not readily applicable to establish a sustainable MSWM system. Even though Brazilian cities are strongly being influenced by concepts developed in high-income countries to search for strategic policies and long-term action plans for MSWM, many decisions makers have not paid much attention to an overall sustainability approach so far. Against this backdrop, the present paper introduces the municipal solid waste diagram (MSWD) as a comprehensive framework for assessing the current state of a MSWM system against a future sustainable one. The normative foundation of MSWD is the Integrative Concept of Sustainability (ICoS), which contrasts the conventional approach of sustainability which typically characterizes a sustainable future along the three dimensions of economy, environment and society. ICoS points out crucial documents for sustainable development (e.g., Brundtland report and Agenda 21), and moreover, it does not neglect the potential of the capability approach. By this, the dynamic interrelationship between the abovementioned dimensions is taken into account. Another characteristic of the MSWD is the strong involvement of stakeholders, experts, and decision-makers during the construction and application of that instrument. Their central task was to certify the relevance, compatibility, flexibility of the chosen nine assessment criteria and the related 18 indicators on the ground of the ICoS. Any other study is known which looks for the dynamics of MSWM. The proposed approach helps to identify the constitute elements of MSWM clearly and to match to goals of sustainability without distinguishing and prioritizing any dimensionality. This approach clarifies the scientific background for sustainable development in the process of decision making regarding MSWM which is not done by conventional sustainability assessment methodologies. By the participation of the most relevant stakeholders of Belo Horizonte, the municipal solid waste diagram is verified. Belo Horizonte has currently obtained a level of development of about one third towards the goals of sustainability. The city had the best performance on securing human existence, in which the individual protection takes currently a high priority. The presented MSWD and thus the findings are specific to Belo Horizonte, but not the proposed approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

More concretely, Fe3O4@MoS2 nanohybrid was prepared and used as an additive for liquid paraffin (LP), resulting in enhanced lubricating properties together with significant photocatalytic degradation performance. The nanohybrid was prepared via a hydrothermal method, which was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. The frictional properties together with photocatalytic degradation behaviors of LP mixtures containing MoS2, Fe3O4, and Fe3O4@MoS2 nanohybrid were under a comparative investigation. The results show that the LP mixture containing 0.08 wt % of Fe3O4@MoS2 nanohybrid can achieve the maximum reduction of friction coefficient; while that containing 0.10 wt % of the nanohybrid possesses the most excellent photocatalytic activity. According to the mechanism analysis, the multifunctional system containing Fe3O4@MoS2 nanohybrid works under a synergistic mechanism by multicomponents, which can be regarded as a preliminary attempt to move along the idea of full-life-cycle green design of a lubricating oil system.\",\"[Liu, Lei; Jiao, Songlong; Zhou, Wei] Southeast Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Design & Manufacture Micro Nano B, Sch Mech Engn, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Peng, Yitian] Donghua Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China\",\"Liu, L (reprint author), Southeast Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Design & Manufacture Micro Nano B, Sch Mech Engn, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.\",liulei@seu.edu.cn,,,\"Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar of Jiangsu Province [BK20170023]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51675360, 51675502, 51775105, 51775001, 51775530, 51775051]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [3202006301, 3202006403]; Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province; International Foundation for Science, Stockholm, Sweden; Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, The Hague, Netherlands [F/4736-2]; Top 6 High-Level Talents Program of Jiangsu Province [2017-GDZB-006]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20150505]; Tribology Science Fund of State Key Laboratory of Tribology [SKLTKF15A11]; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of High Performance Complex Manufacturing, Central South University [Kfkt2016-11]; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Fire Science [HZ2017-KF05]; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of solid lubrication [LSL-1607]\",\"This work is financially supported by the Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar of Jiangsu Province (BK20170023), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51675360, 51675502, 51775105, 51775001, 51775530, 51775051), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (3202006301, 3202006403), the Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province, the International Foundation for Science, Stockholm, Sweden, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, The Hague, Netherlands, through a grant to Lei Liu (F/4736-2), the grants from Top 6 High-Level Talents Program of Jiangsu Province(2017-GDZB-006, Class A), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20150505), the Tribology Science Fund of State Key Laboratory of Tribology (SKLTKF15A11), Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of High Performance Complex Manufacturing, Central South University (Kfkt2016-11), Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Fire Science (HZ2017-KF05) and Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of solid lubrication (LSL-1607).\",,33.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,6.0,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,\"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA\",2168-0485,,,ACS SUSTAIN CHEM ENG,ACS Sustain.

Here, we make the case that to understand the fitness consequences of foraging and anti-predation behaviour en route we cannot rely on single behaviour relationships but must take many aspects of behaviour into account, because of predation risk compensation. We show this in a case study of fat and vigilant birds feeding close to cover, which emphasises the importance and potential of predation risk compensation. Another reason for taking many aspects of behaviour into account is that different behaviours need not contribute equally to individual fitness. Birds faced with an increased predation risk during migration can compensate for increased predation risk in different ways. This implies that the adaptive value of a behavioural trait can still be ambiguous even if a survival cost can be correlated with particular behaviour where all other things are equal (e.g. in an experiment). That is because in natural systems there may frequently be many other ways for animals to compensate, because all other things are never equal, so that the particular behaviour can actually be of little consequence to individual fitness. In conclusion, when studying foraging decisions and anti-predation behaviour during stopover potential compensatory mechanisms should be incorporated. This knowledge is also critical for improving future models of optimal migration.\",\"Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews KY16 9TS, Fife, Scotland\",\"Lind, J (reprint author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.\",johan.lind@zoologi.su.se,\"Cresswell, Will/B-1472-2013\",\"Cresswell, Will/0000-0002-4684-7624\",,,,49.0,21.0,24.0,2.0,18.0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,\"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA\",0021-8375,,,J ORNITHOL,J.

The parameter chi(OO) is metal specific and has slightly different values for five and six membered chelate rings. LFERs are presented for 21 different metal ions and are accurate to within approximately 0.30 log units in predictions of log K-ML values. Ligands selected for use in LFER development include dicarboxylic acids, carboxyphenols, and ortho-diphenols. For ortho-hydroxybenzaldehydes, alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids, and alpha-ketocarboxylic acids, a modification of the LFER where log K-HL,K-2 is set equal to zero is required. The chemical interpretation of chi(OO) is that it accounts for the extra stability afforded to metal complexes by the chelate effect. Cu-NOM binding constants calculated from the bidentate LFERs are similar in magnitude to those used in WHAM 6. This LFER can be used to make log K-ML predictions for small organic molecules. Since natural organic matter (NOM) contains many of the same functional groups (i.e. carboxylic acids, phenols, alcohols), the LFER log K-ML predictions shed light on the range of appropriate values for use in modeling metal partitioning in natural systems.

However, there are not sufficient wood resources in many countries or regions, especially those short of land resources. These countries and regions have to import wood from overseas. Therefore, it is imperative to determine how to choose sustainable importing sources in order to improve the sustainability performance of using wood in construction. This study compares the sustainability performance of wood imported from different regions by considering wood harvesting, manufacture, and transportation. A framework accounting energy consumption and CO2 emissions is developed for sustainability assessment. The results show that importing wood from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to Taiwan demands a relatively lower amount of energy than from other regions. Specifically, importing wood from Canada (West) demands the lowest amount of energy (2095 MJ/m(3)), while importing wood form Brazil consumes the highest amount of energy (5356 MJ/m(3)). In addition, findings showed that the CO2 emissions generated from importing wood from Sweden are significant lower than those from other regions, although the energy consumed during the importing process is relatively high. The study also revealed that the wood manufacturing process and marine transportation contribute to the most energy consumption and CO2 emissions among all importing processes analysed from most of studied regions.\",\"[Li, Shenghan; Ding, Zhikun] Shenzhen Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Wu, Huanyu] Univ Adelaide, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia\",\"Wu, HY (reprint author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.\",shenghan@szu.edu.cn; huanyu.wu@adelaide.edu.au; ddzk@szu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51478267],This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC: 51478267).,,37.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,MDPI AG,BASEL,\"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND\",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2018.0,10,1,,,,,,,139,10.3390/su10010139,,,,14.0,GREEN & SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW1TN,WOS:000425082600137,,gold,,,2018-09-20\n",

The complexity and expense of studying diseases in marine systems often dictate that conservation and management decisions are made without quantitative data on population-level impacts of disease. Mark-recapture is a powerful, underutilized, tool for calculating impacts of disease on population size and structure, even in the absence of etiological information. We applied logistic regression models to mark-recapture data to obtain estimates of disease-associated mortality rates in three commercially important marine species: snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) in Newfoundland, Canada, that experience sporadic epizootics of bitter crab disease; striped bass (Morone saxatilis) in the Chesapeake Bay, USA, that experience chronic dermal and visceral mycobacteriosis; and American lobster (Homarus americanus) in the Southern New England stock, that experience chronic epizootic shell disease. All three diseases decreased survival of diseased hosts. Survival of diseased adult male crabs was 1% (0.003-0.022, 95% CI) that of uninfected crabs indicating nearly complete mortality of infected crabs in this life stage. Survival of moderately and severely diseased striped bass (which comprised 15% and 11% of the population, respectively) was 84% (70-100%, 95% CI), and 54% (42-68%, 95% CI) that of healthy striped bass. The disease-adjusted yearly natural mortality rate for striped bass was 0.29, nearly double the previously accepted value, which did not include disease. Survival of moderately and severely diseased lobsters was 30% (15-60%, 95% CI) that of healthy lobsters and survival of mildly diseased lobsters was 45% (27-75%, 95% CI) that of healthy lobsters. High disease mortality in ovigerous females may explain the poor recruitment and rapid declines observed in this population. Stock assessments should account for disease-related mortality when resource management options are evaluated.\",\"[Hoenig, John M.; Groner, Maya L.; Smith, Matthew W.; Vogelbein, Wolfgang K.; Gauthier, David T.; Sadler, Philip; Haines, Ashley N.; Small, Hamish J.; Shields, Jeffrey D.] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; [Taylor, David M.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Sci Branch, POB 5667, St John, NF A1C 5X1, Canada; [Landers, Donald F., Jr.; Swenarton, John T.] Dominion, Millstone Power Stn Environm Lab, Rope Ferry Rd, Waterford, CT 06385 USA; [Matsche, Mark A.] Maryland Dept Nat Resources, Cooperat Oxford Lab, 904 South Morris St, Oxford, MS 21654 USA; [Pradel, Roger; Choquet, Remi] Univ Montpellier, Univ P Valery, CEFE UMR 5175, CNRS,EPHE, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Gauthier, David T.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 202E Mills Godwin Bldg, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Haines, Ashley N.] Norfolk State Univ, Dept Biol, 200F Woods Sci Bldg, Norfolk, VA 23504 USA\",\"Groner, ML (reprint author), Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.\",mlgroner@vims.edu,,,Virginia Marine Resources Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office; Virginia Sea Grant; Virginia Saltwater Recreational Fishing Development Fund; Dominion Energy; Canada Department of Fisheries and Oceans; NSF EID OCE BE-UF [0723662]; NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy program [NA15 NMF4270287],\"J.

Yet most of this work has been conducted in small-scale fluvial system mimics, demonstrating a clear need to investigate the relationship between biodiversity and erosion in natural systems. We conducted an observational field study across 3 rivers in forested watersheds in northern Michigan, U.S.A., quantifying streambank retreat rates using aerial photos and measuring riparian plant community biodiversity and abundance. We hypothesized that more diverse riparian plant communities would produce greater woody plant stem density and basal area, which in turn would reduce erosion rates of streambanks due to increased root production. We used structural equation modelling to compare causal networks using plant biodiversity metrics to predict streambank migration rate indirectly through effects on plant abundance, as well as models that used migration rate to predict plant abundance indirectly through effects on plant biodiversity. Although structural equation models explained both causal pathways successfully, models using biodiversity to predict migration rate were a better fit to data than models that used migration rate to predict plant biodiversity and abundance. The best performing models suggested plant biodiversity was indirectly negatively correlated with erosion rate (average standardized path coefficient=-0.22), after accounting for environmental differences between sites. This work adds to a growing body of evidence indicating that biodiversity can modify geophysical processes, demonstrating the need to explicitly account for biological variation when considering ecogeomorphic feedbacks.\",\"[Allen, Daniel C.; Kopp, Darin A.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Grad Program, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Wynn-Thompson, Theresa M.] Virginia Tech, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Cardinale, Bradley J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA\",\"Allen, DC (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Grad Program, Norman, OK 73019 USA.\",dcallen@ou.edu,,,U.S. National Science Foundation [DBI-1103500]; U.S. Department of Agriculture; McIntire-Stennis Program,\"U.S. National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DBI-1103500; U.S. Department of Agriculture; McIntire-Stennis Program\",,25.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,\"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA\",1936-0584,1936-0592,,ECOHYDROLOGY,Ecohydrology,JUN,2018.0,11,4,,,,,,,UNSP e1972,10.1002/eco.1972,,,,9.0,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,GI2RK,WOS:000434219200015,,,,,2018-07-03\n",

In the present study, an integrative approach is used to investigate the seasonal and spatial dynamics of contamination of sediments from a regularly flooded industrial area in the Czech Republic, which presents a suitable model ecosystem for pollutant distribution research at a regional level. Surface sediments were sampled repeatedly to represent two different hydrological situations: spring (after the peak of high flow) and autumn (after longer period of low flow). Samples were characterized for abiotic parameters and concentrations of priority organic pollutants. Toxicity was assessed by Microtox test; genotoxicity by SOS-chromotest and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-yeast test; and the presence of compounds with specific mode of action by in vitro bioassays for dioxin-like activity, anti-/androgenicity, and anti-/estrogenicity. Distribution of organic contaminants varied among regions and seasonally. Although the results of Microtox and genotoxicity tests were relatively inconclusive, all other specific bioassays led to statistically significant regional and seasonal differences in profiles and allowed clear separation of upstream and downstream regions. The outcomes of these bioassays indicated an association with concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as master variables. There were significant interrelations among dioxin-like activity, antiandrogenicity and content of organic carbon, clay, and concentration of PAHs and PCBs, which documents the significance of abiotic factors in accumulation of pollutants. The study demonstrates the strength of the specific bioassays in indicating the changes in contamination and emphasizes the crucial role of a well-designed sampling plan, in which both spatial and temporal dynamics should be taken into account, for the correct interpretations of information in risk assessments.

Conceptual site models (CSMs) are one tool used by the U. S. Department of Energy ( DOE) and other environmental managers to understand, track, help with decisions, and communicate with the public about the risk from contamination. CSMs are simplified graphical representations of the sources, releases, transport and exposure pathways, and receptors, along with possible barriers to interdict pathways and reduce exposure. In this article, three CSMs are created using Amchitka Island, where the remaining contamination is from underground nuclear test shot cavities containing large quantities of numerous radionuclides in various physical and chemical forms: (1) a typical underground nuclear test shot CSM (modeled after other sites), (2) an expanded CSM with more complex receptors, and (3) a regional CSM that takes into account contaminant pathways from sources other than Amchitka. The objective was to expand the CSM used by DOE to be more responsive to different types of receptors. Amchitka Island differs from other DOE test shot sites because it is surrounded by a marine environment that is highly productive and has a high biodiversity, and the source of contamination is underground, not on the surface. The surrounding waters of the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean are heavily exploited by commercial fisheries and provide the United States and other countries with a significant proportion of its seafood. It is proposed that the CSMs on Amchitka Island should focus more on the pathways of exposure and critical receptors, rather than sources and blocks. Further, CSMs should be incorporated within a larger regional model because of the potentially rapid transport within ocean ecosystems. The large number of migratory or highly mobile species that pass by Amchitka provide the potential for a direct pathway to the local human population, known as Aleut, and commercial fisheries, which are remote from the island itself. The exposure matrix for receptors requires expansion for the Amchitka Island ecosystem because of the valuable marine and seafood resources in the region.

National implementation of such regimes go through different stages of development, from changes 'on paper' in regulations and guidelines (labelled output), to behavioural changes among target groups (labelled outcome) before responses are seen on the natural environment (labelled impacts). The main purpose of this paper is to apply a quantitative bio-economic model for analysing the potential impacts on Norwegian forestry of two international regimes (the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) and an extended version of the Kyoto Protocol), and to discuss the weak and strong points in using this kind of method in policy analysis. Our findings imply that: (i) The CBD regime has rather limited impacts on the forest structure and harvest as long as it is practised with an intensity corresponding to the forest certification schemes used at present in Norway, or with lower intensity. (ii) Practiced with maximum consideration to biodiversity the potential impact of the CBD regime on the forest structure and harvest is strong, and it can reduce the income from timber production by 30% or more compared to present forestry practices. This reduction is highest when forest climate mitigation is given low consideration. (iii) There is a significant mutual relationship between the two regimes analysed, in the meaning that the weaker one of them is implemented, the stronger marginal impact has the other. (iv) Using quantitative bio-economic modelling in policy impact analyses like this contributes to the methodological literature on regime effectiveness, and has several advantages. But due considerations should be given to underlying basic assumptions related to agent behaviour and the ecosystem detail level required.\",\"[Solberg, Birger; Bergseng, Even; Lindstad, Berit H.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway\",\"Solberg, B (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.\",birger.solberg@nmbu.no,,,,,,68.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,\"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS\",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,DEC,2017.0,85,,1,,,,147,160,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.09.003,,,,14.0,Forestry,Forestry,FR3SG,WOS:000418986200015,,,,,2018-07-06\n",

The inlet air cooling applications increase the thermal efficiency and the power generation rate roundly by 3.2 and 7.7%, respectively, while the payback period of the inlet-air cooled system is closely higher than the conventional case. The life cycle-based environmental payback periods of the inlet air-cooled systems are found 3.25, 7.77, and 6.16% less than the conventional systems since the inlet air cooling applications achieve 3.25, 2.54, and 2.47% emission reductions of 30, 65, and 200 kW microturbine models, respectively. The integration of the life cycle assessment parameters increases the classical enviroeconomic parameters roundly by 100%. Moreover, different electricity and gas prices are studied to have more reliable data about the real engineering applications of the proposed systems. India, USA and Mexico are selected as the LNG importer countries for the case studies, and it is seen that the cold energy based inlet air cooling applications are more commercially viable for the regions where the fuel costs are relatively high whereas the systems become unfeasible with the low electricity prices.

Connectedness to nature contributes to well-being and is a precursor for environmentally responsible behavior. Integrating nature into urban landscapes might facilitate human-nature reconnection. This paper presents the results of an exploratory qualitative case study undertaken in Portland, Oregon in which I conducted 42 semi-structured interviews with community members. The results suggest that in order to address a human connection to nature at least two aspects of urban retrofit should be considered: (1) incorporate multiple scales and types of nature for multiple experiences; and (2) provide opportunities for hands on work in nature and personal control of space. As we retrofit both shrinking and growing cities in this era of uncertainty and change, this research offers insight into the creation of livable, nature-full cities.\",\"[Church, Sarah P.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA\",\"Church, SP (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.\",church9@purdue.edu,,,USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Postdoctoral Fellowship funding,\"Thank you to Maged Senbel, John Friedmann, and Ron Kellett who critiqued an initial draft of this research; John's critical eye was particularly valuable and he is greatly missed.

As MPAs have proliferated, the conservation community has begun to supplement traditional biological metrics with social and community considerations in the way it seeks to manage and evaluate such tools. To assess management outcomes and opportunities for a network of community -based, marine no-take zones (NTZs) in the Mexican Caribbean, semi-structured interviews were carried out with fishers and key management stakeholders. Findings indicate that the community-based management strategy has inherent tradeoffs between community engagement and conservation potential. Managers have succeeded in fostering high levels of community support for the initiative, but significant challenges remain, most notably the high presence of illegal fishing within NTZs. Successes and challenges of the community-based management strategy are documented and evaluated within a fisheries resource management framework. As the NTZ network undergoes legal renovation following the completion of its initial five-year term, this work serves as an important resource for both reflection on, and adaptation of, the community-based NTZ management regime.\",\"[Ayer, Austin; Fulton, Stuart; Alejandro Caamal-Madrigal, Jacobo] Comunidad & Biodiversidad AC, Isla del Peruano 215, Guaymas 85448, Sonora, Mexico; [Ayer, Austin; Espinoza-Tenorio, Alejandro] El Colegio Frontera Sur ECOSUR, Av Rancho Poligono 2-A, Lerma Campeche 24500, Campeche, Mexico\",\"Espinoza-Tenorio, A (reprint author), El Colegio Frontera Sur ECOSUR, Av Rancho Poligono 2-A, Lerma Campeche 24500, Campeche, Mexico.\",ayeraustinm@gmail.com; sfulton@cobi.org.mx; jcaamal@cobi.org.mx; aespinoza@ecosur.mx,,,U.S. Fulbright Program; Comision Mexico-Estados Unidos para el Intercambio Educativo y Cultural (COMEXUS); Summit Foundation [20180011]; Oak Foundation [OCAY-13-569]; Walton Family Foundation [2015-1516],\"This work was supported by the U.S. Fulbright Program and the Comision Mexico-Estados Unidos para el Intercambio Educativo y Cultural (COMEXUS), with additional fieldwork funding generously provided by Summit Foundation [grant number 20180011], Oak Foundation [grant number OCAY-13-569], and the Walton Family Foundation [grant number 2015-1516].

However, current levels of conservation investment are not likely to mitigate degradation to natural capital and ecosystem services. We propose the further evolution of a conservation industry to generate substantially increased investment in conservation in agricultural landscapes, particularly from the private sector. A mature conservation industry is envisaged as comprising of investors, producers, and service providers who produce conservation products and services, exchanged via market transactions. A number of requirements for a viable and effective conservation industry are identified including institutional infrastructure (conservation market institutions and regulatory systems), information provision (quantifying benefits, business models, and accounting and auditing standards), and facilitation (entrepreneurship incubation and capacity building). A conservation industry requires careful design and planning in order to operate effectively. Whilst it is not without risk, a conservation industry has the potential to increase participation and investment in conservation actions and enhance the sustainability of agricultural landscapes.

The burden in older children may justify extending the age range, as has been done effectively in Senegal. We examine costs of door-to-door SMC delivery to children up to 10 years by community health workers (CHWs). We analysed incremental financial and economic costs at district level and below from a health service perspective. We examined project accounts and prospectively collected data from 405 CHWs, 46 health posts, and 4 district headquarters by introducing questionnaires in advance and completing them after each monthly implementation round. Affordability was explored by comparing financial costs of SMC to relevant existing health expenditure levels. Costs were disaggregated by administration month and by health service level. We used linear regression models to identify factors associated with cost variation between health posts. The financial cost to administer SMC to 180 000 children over one malaria season, reaching similar to 93% of children with all three intended courses of SMC was $234 549 (constant 2010 USD) or $0.50 per monthly course administered. Excluding research-participation incentives, the financial cost was $0.32 per resident (all ages) in the catchment area, which is 1.2% of Senegal's general government expenditure on health per capita. Economic costs were 18.7% higher than financial costs at $278 922 or $0.59 per course administered and varied widely between health posts, from $0.38 to $2.74 per course administered. Substantial economies of scale across health posts were found, with the smallest health posts incurring highest average costs per monthly course administered. SMC for children up to 10 is likely to be affordable, particularly where it averts substantial curative care costs. Estimates of likely costs and cost-effectiveness of SMC in other contexts must account for variation in average costs across delivery months and health posts.\",\"[Pitt, Catherine] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London, England; [Ndiaye, Mouhamed; Sy, Ousmane; Cisse, Badara; Gaye, Oumar; Ndiaye, Jean-Louis] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, Dept Parasitol, Dakar, Senegal; [Conteh, Lesong] Imperial Coll London, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Hlth Econ Grp, London, England; [Ba, El Hadj; Gomis, Jules F.] Inst Rech Dev, Dakar, Senegal; [Ba, El Hadj; Cisse, Badara; Milligan, Paul J.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England\",\"Pitt, C (reprint author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London, England.\",catherine.pitt@lshtm.ac.uk,,\"Milligan, Paul/0000-0003-3430-3395\",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [40099]; Economic and Social Research Council,\"The work was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [grant number 40099] and the Economic and Social Research Council.

Wood is expected to become a major biomass resource in bioeconomy regions. Therefore, this paper develops a social life cycle assessment (sLCA) framework that can be applied specifically to a wood-based production system in one of Germany's bioeconomy regions. This paper reviews and analyses existing sLCA approaches, in terms of how applicable they are for assessing a wood-based production system in a German bioeconomy regional context. The analysis is structured according to the standard phases of environmental life cycle assessment (LCA). However, we use the term social effects rather than social impacts, to acknowledge the unknown cause-effect relationship between an organisation's activities and its social impacts. We also consider the establishment of regional system boundaries, as well as the relationship between the social effects and the product being assessed. Additionally, an approach for the development and selection of social indicators and indices is outlined. Furthermore, we discuss data requirements and present an approach for a social life cycle impact assessment method. A new conceptual framework for a context-specific sLCA to assess wood-based products manufactured in a bioeconomy region was developed. It enables sLCA practitioners to identify \"\"social hotspots\"\" and \"\"social opportunities\"\" from a regional perspective. The location and characteristics of these social hotspots and opportunities can be analysed, in particular, for major production activities in a bioeconomy region in Germany. Therefore, according to this framework, the development of social indices and indicators, the collection of data and the approach used for characterising social effects need to relate to the geographical context of the product being assessed. The proposed framework can, thus, help to identify, monitor and evaluate the social sustainability of wood-based bioeconomy chains in a regional context. This framework requires a high level of detail in the social inventory and impact assessment phase, in order to assess the regional foreground activities in a German wood-based bioeconomy region. It enables sLCA studies to identify which social hotspots and social opportunities occur and where they are located in the wood-based production system of a regional bioeconomy.\",\"[Siebert, Anke; Bezama, Alberto; O'Keeffe, Sinead; Thraen, Daniela] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Bioenergy, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Thraen, Daniela] Deutsch Biomasseforschungszentrum DBFZ, Bioenergy Syst Dept, Torgauer Str 116, D-04347 Leipzig, Germany\",\"Siebert, A (reprint author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Bioenergy, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.\",anke.siebert@ufz.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research,The authors gratefully thank the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research for their financial support.,,49.0,3.0,3.0,11.0,11.0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,\"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY\",0948-3349,1614-7502,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

The latter include a number of biotechnologies that can support the sustainability of key ecosystem services effectively. Lake Naivasha has been an economic development hub of Kenya since pre-colonial times. Now it is dominated by geothermal power production, horticulture and floriculture, hotel and hospitality, small and medium enterprises around the lake, together with intensive smallholder cultivations and pasture in the catchment. Natural resources in the basin have continually attracted diverse local and foreign investments. Advancement in technologies, together with a rapid rise in human population, have exacerbated pressure upon the basin's natural capital. Conflicts between interest groups have often erupted due to fluctuations in water availability and limitations of access to private land. Flower growers, pastoralists, fisher-folk, hoteliers, upper catchment and lower catchment communities often accuse one another of engaging in malpractices over resource use. These conflicts have more recently resulted in partnerships in resource management however, which have helped in the implementation of research-informed mitigation measures. The most important is the formation of an \"\"umbrella'' organisation, Imarisha Naivasha, a quasi-government body set up to catalyse sustainability moves. It sought to achieve this with a Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP; 2012-17) and, with funding mainly from the Dutch government, an Integrated Water Resource Allocation Plan (IWRAP), for catchment-wide use of surface and ground waters. On smaller scales, successful case studies have demonstrated practical ways forward - a Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programme in one sub-catchment has reduced upper catchment erosion; restoration of small dams in another has provided more reliable and cleaner rural water, flood retention and enhanced biodiversity; around the lake, promotion of artificial wetlands that now treat effluent waters from about half the horticultural enterprises. Recently, proposed new \"\"mega-projects'' by both the National, and the Nakuru County governments have brought uncertainty upon the future state of the lake and its catchment. Plans to develop an industrial park and an inland container port for the new Kenyan Standard Gauge Railway from Mombasa to Naivasha, together with the proposal to develop and market Naivasha further as an ecotourism and conferencing destination, have enhanced speculation on investment opportunities and demographic trends, attracting new investors and jobseekers. Within the framework of ecohydrology, we summarise proposed developments and the management challenges they pose and provide examples of ecohydrological tools recommended to contain the negative impacts on fundamental ecosystem processes. We review the probability of the successful application of such tools. (C) 2017 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier Sp. z o.o.

We interpret this evidence through the lens of an equilibrium life-cycle, span-of-control model where managers invest in their skills. We use the model to quantify the importance of exogenous productivity differences and the size-dependent distortions emphasized in the misallocation literature. Our findings indicate that such distortions are critical to generate the observed differences in the growth of relative managerial earnings across countries. Distortions that halve the growth of relative managerial earnings, a move from the U.S. to Italy in our data, lead to a reduction in managerial quality of 27% and to a reduction in output of about nearly 7% - more than half of the observed gap between the U.S. and Italy.

Part of that effort has focused on the role of the environment in providing secure livelihoods through provisioning ecosystem services. However, many of the models of environment migration linkages fail to acknowledge the importance of social and psychological factors in the decision to migrate. Here, we seek to provide a more comprehensive model of migration decision-making under environmental change by investigating the attachment people form to place, and the role of the environment in creating that attachment. We hypothesize that environmental factors enter the migration decision-making process through their contribution to place utility, defined as a function of both affective and instrumental bonds to location, and that ecosystem services, the aspects of ecosystems that create wellbeing, contribute to both components of place utility. We test these ideas in four rural highland settlements in Peru sampled along an altitudinal gradient. We find that non-economic ecosystem services are important in creating place attachment and that ecological place attachment exists independently of use of provisioning ecosystem services. Individuals' attitudes to ecosystem services vary with the type of ecosystem services available at a location and the degree of rurality. While social and economic factors are the dominant drivers of migration in these locations, a loss of non-provisioning ecosystem services leads to a decrease in place utility and commitment to place, determining factors in the decision to migrate. The findings suggest that policy interventions encouraging migration as an adaptation to environmental change will have limited success if they only focus on provisioning services. A much wider set of individuals will experience a decrease in place utility, and migration will be unable to alleviate that decrease since the factors that create it are specific to place.\",\"[Adams, Helen; Adger, W.

AMD has resulted in controversial debates in this country where the ownership of mines has traditionally been characterized by policies of the apartheid era that downplayed community participation in environmental decision making. This case study therefore aimed to find out stakeholder perceptions of the history, management, and decision-making approaches on AMD in South Africa. The study also aimed to ascertain if adoption of the precautionary principle (PP) would have made a difference to the decisions that are known to have led to the problem of AMD in this country. The results indicated that AMD is not only an issue resulting from the lack of resources and skills in its management but mainly a public participation and decision-making issue. These results, therefore, have implications for the revision of decision-making approaches and the extent to which public participation grounded in the philosophy of the PP is facilitated in environmental decision making.\",\"[Mpofu, Charles] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Interprofess Hlth Studies, P Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Morodi, Thabiso John] Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Environm Hlth, Pretoria, South Africa; [Hattingh, Johan Petrus] Univ Stellenbosch, Philosophy, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Stellenbosch, South Africa\",\"Mpofu, C (reprint author), Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Interprofess Hlth Studies, P Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.\",charlesmpofu@hotmail.com,,,,,,40.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,9.0,\"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC\",NEW ROCHELLE,\"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA\",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

The notion of social-ecological systems is used as the conceptual framework for this analysis, in which the former bantustan region of Bushbuckridge is posited as a cultural landscape. The local landscape showed distinctive modifications over the study period, broad trends including the growth of human settlements and the decrease in woodland cover. However, changes were not uniform across sites, and the direction and magnitude of changes in land cover were often nonlinear and site-specific. Analysis of associations between biophysical and socio-economic changes at different scales revealed a range of important interacting forces such as population growth, drought, shortages of land, grazing and wood resources, weakening institutional governance of natural resources, and the diversification of livelihood strategies, including the sale of fuelwood, concurrent with declining employment security and cattle ownership. Evidence suggests a possible erosion of resilience in these social-ecological systems at various scales, with important implications for socio-economic development and sustainable resource management.\",\"Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa; Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa\",\"Giannecchini, M (reprint author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa.\",twine@gecko.biol.wits.ac.za,,\"Twine, Wayne/0000-0002-4163-198X\",,,,76.0,51.0,52.0,3.0,32.0,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,\"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA\",0016-7398,,,GEOGR J,Geogr.

A total of 418 participants from the Multicultural Community Health Assessment Trial were assessed for visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAT), anthropometric variables, blood pressure, and lipid, insulin, and glucose levels. Multiple regression analyses were split by sex and adjusted for appropriate covariates in model 1a and further adjusted for VAT in model 1b or SAT in model 1c. A secondary model replaced body mass index (BMI) with waist circumference (WC). Chinese males had higher levels of triglycerides, insulin, homeostasis model assessment, and SAT than European males, as well as higher total cholesterol (TC), glucose, and VAT in the model adjusted for WC. Chinese females had higher glucose levels than European females after adjustment for either BMI or WC. When VAT was added to the models, differences in cardiometabolic risk factors remained significant but were attenuated between Chinese and European males and females; SAT did not attenuate the ethnic difference in cardiometabolic risk. These findings suggest that the higher VAT levels seen in the Chinese population do not fully account for the ethnic disparities in these risk factors. Given the observed interethnic difference in body composition, current BMI and WC cutoffs might be misleading when it comes to identifying Chinese individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease.\",\"[Lesser, Iris A.; Gasevic, Danijela; Lear, Scott A.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biomed Physiol & Kinesiol, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K3, Canada; [Lear, Scott A.] Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Lear, Scott A.] Providence Hlth Care, Div Cardiol, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada\",\"Lear, SA (reprint author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biomed Physiol & Kinesiol, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K3, Canada.\",slear@providencehealth.bc.ca,,\"Gasevic, Danijela/0000-0001-5976-4011\",\"Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism, and Diabetes\",\"This work was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism, and Diabetes.

To reduce these negative impacts of the transportation sector, synthetic fuels are currently being developed, which are produced from renewable energy stored via catalytic conversion of hydrogen (H-2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). A promising class of synthetic fuels are oxymethylene ethers (OMEs). This study conducts a prospective environmental assessment of an OME-based fuel using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). We investigate an OME1-diesel-blend (OME1-blend), where OME1 replaces 24 mass% of diesel fuel. Such an OME1-blend could be a first step towards an OME transition. For the production of OME1 from CO2-based methanol, we consider both the established route via condensation with formaldehyde and a novel direct pathway based on catalytic combination with CO2 and hydrogen. To close the carbon loop, CO2 supply via biogas and direct air capture is considered. In a best-case scenario, hydrogen is produced by water electrolysis using electricity from wind power in the European Union as an input. The direct pathway reduces the required process steps from three to two and is shown to allow for an improved utilization of the energy provided by hydrogen: the exergy efficiency is increased from 74% to 86%. For combustion, we conducted experiments in a single cylinder engine to determine the full spectrum of engine-related emissions. The engine data provide the input for simulations of the cumulative raw emissions over the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedures (WLTP) cycle for a mid-size passenger vehicle. Our well-to-wheel LCA shows that OME1 has the potential to serve as an almost carbon-neutral blending component: replacing 24 mass% of diesel by OME1 could reduce the GW impact by 22% and the emissions of NOx and soot even by 43% and 75%, respectively. The key to achieving these benefits is the integration of renewable energy in hydrogen production. The cumulative energy demand (CED) over the life cycle is doubled compared to fossil diesel. With sufficient renewable electricity available, OME1-blends may serve as a promising first step towards a more sustainable transportation sector.\",\"[Deutz, Sarah; Kaetelhoen, Arne; Bardow, Andre] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech Thermodynam, Schinkelstr 8, D-52062 Aachen, Germany; [Bongartz, Dominik; Langenhorst, Luisa Schulze; Mitsos, Alexander] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Proc Syst Engn AVT SVT, Forckenbeckstr 1, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Heuser, Benedikt; Omari, Ahmad; Walters, Marius; Pischinger, Stefan] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Combust Engines, Forckenbeckstr 4, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Klankermayer, Juergen; Leitner, Walter] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech & Macromol Chem, Worringerweg 1, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Leitner, Walter] Max Planck Inst Chem Energy Convers, Stiftstr 34-36, D-45470 Mulheim, Germany\",\"Bardow, A (reprint author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech Thermodynam, Schinkelstr 8, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.\",andre.bardow@ltt.rwth-aachen.de,\"Leitner, Walter/D-3031-2015\",\"Leitner, Walter/0000-0001-6100-9656; Bree, Luisa Carola/0000-0002-0116-4563; Mitsos, Alexander/0000-0003-0335-6566\",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); Excellence Initiative by the German federal and state governments,\"This work was performed within the \"\"Competence Center Power to Fuel'' of RWTH Aachen University established as part of the Excellence Initiative by the German federal and state governments to promote science and research at German universities.

This has urged scientific communities to improve the understanding of future climate and reduce the uncertainties associated with projections. In the present study, ten statistically downscaled CMIP5 GCMs at 1/16th deg. spatial resolution from two different downscaling procedures are utilized over the Columbia River Basin (CRB) to assess the changes in climate variables and characterize the associated uncertainties. Three climate variables, i.e. precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature, are studied for the historical period of 1970-2000 as well as future period of 2010-2099, simulated with representative concentration pathways of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is employed to reduce the model uncertainty and develop a probabilistic projection for each variable in each scenario. Historical comparison of long-term attributes of GCMs and observation suggests a more accurate representation for BMA than individual models. Furthermore, BMA projections are used to investigate future seasonal to annual changes of climate variables. Projections indicate significant increase in annual precipitation and temperature, with varied degree of change across different sub-basins of CRB. We then characterized uncertainty of future projections for each season over CRB. Results reveal that model uncertainty is the main source of uncertainty, among others. However, downscaling uncertainty considerably contributes to the total uncertainty of future projections, especially in summer. On the contrary, downscaling uncertainty appears to be higher than scenario uncertainty for precipitation.\",\"[Ahmadalipour, Ali; Moradkhani, Hamid] Portland State Univ, Remote Sensing & Water Resources Lab, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Rana, Arun] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Norrkoping, Sweden\",\"Ahmadalipour, A (reprint author), Portland State Univ, Remote Sensing & Water Resources Lab, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Portland, OR 97207 USA.\",aahmad2@pdx.edu,,,DOE [00063182],\"Partial financial support for this study was provided by the DOE, cooperative agreement 00063182.\",,67.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,8.0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,\"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA\",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Current models of health profession education often fail to produce a fit-for-purpose workforce ready and willing to provide relevant, quality care to underserved communities. Evidence is emerging that community-engaged and socially accountable health workforce education, i.e., aligned with priority health needs, produces a workforce ready and willing to work in partnership with underserved regions. This model of education fosters greater affiliation between education and service delivery systems and requires institutions to measure graduate outcomes and institutional impact. The Training for Health Equity Network (THEnet), a partnership of socially accountable health workforce education institutions, has developed and tested a Social Accountability Framework for Health Workforce Education (the Framework) and toolkit to improve alignment of health workforce education with outcomes to assess how well education institutions meet the needs of the communities they serve. The Framework links education and service delivery creating a continuous quality improvement feedback loop to ensure that education addresses needs and maximizes impact on the quality of service delivery. The Framework also provides a unifying set of guidelines for health workforce policy and planning, accreditation, education, research, and service delivery. A key element to ensuring consistent high quality service delivery is an appropriately trained and equitably distributed workforce. An effective and comprehensive mechanism for evaluation is the method of CQI which links the design, implementation, accreditation, and evaluation of health workforce education with health service delivery and health outcomes measurement.\",\"[Clithero, Amy] Univ New Mexico, Sch Med, Family & Community Med, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Ross, Simone Jacquelyn] James Cook Univ, Coll Med & Dent, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Ross, Simone Jacquelyn; Middleton, Lyn; Neusy, Andre-Jacques] Training Hlth Equity Network, New York, NY USA; [Middleton, Lyn] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Hlth Sci, Durban, South Africa; [Reeve, Carole] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Med, Alice Springs, NT, Australia\",\"Clithero, A (reprint author), Univ New Mexico, Sch Med, Family & Community Med, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.\",aclithero@salud.unm.edu,,,,,,28.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,\"PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND\",2296-2565,,,FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,Front.

Such a leakage can occur because water is soluble and diffuses in the quartz lattice. Dislocations are preferential sites for the water point defects and preferential diffusion paths. A large density of dislocations is likely to enhance water leakage. Several models have been proposed to interpret this water leakage in natural systems. They are reappraised in the present paper from a quantitative point of view. We show that sweeping out water of fluid inclusions through mobile dislocations would require a tremendous amount of deformation. Pipe diffusion along dislocations does not significantly enhance the kinetics of water leakage. Under normal metamorphic conditions the solubility of water is too low to account for water leakage by re-hydration of the host matrix; however, its diffusivity is high enough to allow exchanges between fluid inclusions and the environment. This is the most likely process for water leakage from fluid inclusions in natural rocks.\",\"CTR RECH SYNTH CHIM MINERAUX,CNRS,F-45071 ORLEANS 2,FRANCE\",\"CORDIER, P (reprint author), UNIV SCI & TECHNOL LILLE,STRUCT & PROPRIETES ETAT SOLIDE LAB,CNRS,URA 234,F-59655 VILLENEUVE DASCQ,FRANCE.\",,\"Ramboz, Claire/B-3442-2015; Cordier, Patrick/D-2357-2012\",\"Cordier, Patrick/0000-0002-1883-2994\",,,,35.0,14.0,15.0,0.0,1.0,E SCHWEIZERBART'SCHE VERLAGS,STUTTGART,\"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY\",0935-1221,,,EUR J MINERAL,Eur.

However, the anthropogenic focus of the concept also requires a detailed understanding of the stakeholders interested in the goods and services ecosystems provide. Indeed, linking ecosystem services to stakeholders and systematically mapping their potential stakes in these is essential for effective, equitable and sustainable ecosystem governance and management because it specifies who is in the system and why. This paper endeavours to provide a better appreciation of systematic stakeholder analysis in ecosystem services research by, first, presenting an illustrative stakeholder analysis example, using a key natural resource in relation to ecosystem services: forests in the UK. In this exploratory study, a qualitative approach was adopted, using a literature review and interviews to identify the stakeholders with a stake in the provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services of forests, to distinguish their characteristics, and to examine their relationships towards each other on different levels. The illustrative example then informed the design of a conceptual framework for the systematic application of stakeholder analysis in ecosystem services research. The comprehensive framework consists of a three-phase model entailing the planning phase, the execution of the actual stakeholder analysis phase, and, finally the subsequent actions. The framework incorporates stakeholders and ecosystem services on a geographical, institutional and ecosystem level. Systematic stakeholder analysis can be used to develop future activities linked to ecosystem services, including new policy or instruments, stakeholder engagement activities, and decision-making processes.

However, for wetlands and impacts from water consumption, it is so far not possible to account for transformation impacts. It is our goal to close this research gap, by determining wetland recovery times and developing characterization factors for transformation. To do this, we conducted a meta-analysis of 59 studies analyzing biodiversity recovery in wetlands subject to passive and active restoration. Generalized linear models were fitted to the biodiversity data and age, along with other wetland characteristics (such as elevation, latitude, or climate class), and were used as predictor variables. The results indicate that elevation, latitude, type of wetland, and restoration method have the strongest effect on recovery speed. Recovery times vary from less than one year to a maximum of 10(7) years with passive restoration and 10(5) years with active restoration. Corresponding transformation characterization factors vary between 10(-14) and 10(-2) species-eq.year(2)/m(3). Finally, recognizing the relevance of this work to real-world policy issues beyond LCA, we discuss the implications of our estimated restoration times on the feasibility of \"\"biodiversity offsetting\"\". Offsetting utilizes restoration to replace biodiversity value lost due to development impacts. Our work can help stakeholders make informed decisions on whether offsetting represents a legitimate policy option in a particular context.\",\"[Pezzati, Lorenzo; Hellweg, Stefanie] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn IfU, John von Neumann Weg 9, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Verones, Francesca] NTNU, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, Ind Ecol Programme, Sem Saelands Vei 7, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Curran, Michael] Res Inst Organ Agr FiBL, Socioecon Dept, Ackerstr 113, CH-5070 Frick, Switzerland; [Baustert, Paul] LIST, 5 Ave Hauts Fourneaux, L-4362 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Baustert, Paul] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Built Environm, NL-5612 AZ Eindhoven, Netherlands\",\"Verones, F (reprint author), NTNU, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, Ind Ecol Programme, Sem Saelands Vei 7, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.\",francesca.verones@ntnu.no,,\"Hellweg, Stefanie/0000-0001-6376-9878\",,,,31.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,8.0,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,\"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA\",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

Sustainable building is the practice of designing, constructing, operating, maintaining, and removing buildings in ways that conserve natural resources and reduce pollution. Rating systems provide effective framework for assessing building environmental performance and they measure a building's sustainability by applying a set of criteria organized in different categories. A good Green Building Rating System (GBRS) should cover key indicators reflecting a building's characteristics and keep their performance in balance. This paper proposed a knowledge-based expert system as a tool to assess the performance level of a green building based on assessment factors of green building rating systems. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and fuzzy logic is adopted in order to develop the knowledge-based expert system. The data for this research collected from the experts in the field via pair-wise and Likert-based questionnaires. Using AHP, the most important parameters of rating systems according to their weights selected to be incorporated in the Fuzzy Inferences System (FIS) of fuzzy logic model. The fuzzy rules (knowledge) discovered from the collected data for FIS to assess the performance level of the green buildings from the Environmental, Social and Economical perspectives denoted as SE2. The outcome of this research is accordingly a performance assessment tool that analyzes the effect of factors in developing the sustainable building. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

High-resolution studies of nitrogen flows are invaluable to increase nitrogen use efficiencies and reduce environmental emissions. In this study, a comprehensive substance flow analysis of nitrogen for China in 2014 is presented. Based on the conceptual framework, which highlights the key roles of human drivers, the analysis of the synthetic ammonia supply and demand balance shows that 75% of ammonia is used for agricultural purposes. Moreover, the life cycle analysis of food nitrogen shows that human food consumption accounts for approximately 7% of the total Nr inputs. A quantitative analysis of pollutant emissions shows that industrial and crop production are the main sources of atmospheric emissions, while livestock farming and crop production are the main sources of water emissions. Finally, we investigate four scenarios (efficiency improvement, high recycling rate, nitrogen oxide emission reduction, and a combined scenario) and provide relevant policy recommendations (large farm size, standardized agricultural production model, flue gas denitration, etc.) for improving nitrogen management practices.\",\"[Luo, Zhibo; Hu, Shanying; Chen, Dingjiang; Zhu, Bing] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Ctr Ind Ecol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China\",\"Hu, SY (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Ctr Ind Ecol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.\",hxr-dce@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [L1522024]; Chinese Academy of Engineering [2015-ZCQ-05],This study was supported through National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Code: L1522024) and Chinese Academy of Engineering (Project Code: 2015-ZCQ-05).,,81.0,2.0,2.0,28.0,28.0,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,\"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA\",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

Current urban waste regulations, however, face increasing challenges from stakeholders' tradeoffs and hierarchic management. A combined method, i.e., life cycle inventories and scenario analysis, was employed to investigate waste-related GHG emissions during 1995-2015 and to project future scenarios of waste-driven carbon emissions by 2050 in a pilot low carbon city, Xiamen, China. The process-based carbon analysis of waste generation (prevention and separation), transportation (collection and transfer) and disposal (treatment and recycling) shows that the main contributors of carbon emissions are associated with waste disposal processes, solid waste, the municipal sector and Xiamen Mainland. Significant spatial differences of waste-related CO2e emissions were observed between Xiamen Island and Xiamen Mainland using the carbon intensity and density indexes. An uptrend of waste-related CO2e emissions from 2015 to 2050 is identified in the business as usual, waste disposal optimization, waste reduction and the integrated scenario, with mean annual growth rates of 8.86%, 8.42%, 6.90% and 6.61%, respectively. The scenario and sensitivity analysis imply that effective waste-related carbon reduction requires trade-offs among alternative strategies, actions and stakeholders in a feasible plan, and emphasize a priority of waste prevention and collection in Xiamen. Our results could benefit to the future modeling of urban multiple wastes and life-cycle carbon control in similar cities within and beyond China. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We introduce a novel whole-economy analytical framework which harmonises multiple national accounting procedures. The economic elements align with the International System of National Accounts. In a modular fashion, our framework curates and maintains disparate accounts (economic stocks and flows, energy use, employment, transport) in parallel, but retains each of their unique measurement unit and accounting requirements. We present the UK as a case study to demonstrate how the data organisation and conditioning procedures are generic and will allow model development for other countries. The framework is capable of exploiting time-series ratios between different measurement units to give key functional relationships that vary gradually over time, are robust and thus useful for analysing national policy complexities such as decarbonisation, employment, investment and balance of payments. We use novel Sankey diagrams to visualise snapshots of the whole system. The framework is neither an exclusively economic, physical, nor social model. It upholds the integrity of each world-view through retaining their unique time-series datasets.

Dietary specialization, whereby an individual exploits a subset of resources available to the rest of the population, can develop in response to environmental or intrinsic population factors. However, accurate assessment of individual diets may be difficult because analyses of recent food intake may misrepresent foraging variability within a heterogeneous environment. We used quantitative fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA) and a novel index of longitudinal dietary change to examine the individual foraging patterns of 64 polar bears Ursus maritimus successively sampled in Western and Southern Hudson Bay between 1994-2003. Estimated diets varied between and within age and sex classes, with adult male polar bears consuming significantly more bearded seal Erignathus barbatus than adult female or subadult bears, whose diets were dominated by ringed seal Pusa hispida. Among individual adult males, consumption of bearded seal accounted for 0-98% of the diet and bearded seal consumption was positively correlated with individual dietary specialization, as measured by proportional similarity (PS(i)) to the rest of the population. Most individual diets were consistent from year-to-year and were therefore not a product of short-term heterogeneity in prey distribution. However, a novel dietary change index indicated that adult male polar bears had the most temporally variable diets with 23% of adult males switching their diet from predominantly ringed seal to predominantly bearded seal or vice versa. We conclude that QFASA is well-suited to analyses of individual-level foraging because it reflects an animal's diet over the preceding weeks to months. The subpopulations of bears in this study were near the southern limit of their species range and have experienced negative individual-and population-level impacts related to sea ice loss and climate warming. The tightly constrained diets of some individuals, particularly adult females and subadults, may make them especially sensitive to future climate change.\",\"[Thiemann, Gregory W.; Iverson, Sara J.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada; [Stirling, Ian] Environm Canada, Wildlife Res Sect, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada; [Stirling, Ian] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Obbard, Martyn E.] Trent Univ, Ontario Minist Nat Resources, Wildlife Res & Dev Sect, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada\",\"Thiemann, GW (reprint author), York Univ, Fac Environm Studies, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.\",thiemann@yorku.ca,\"Thiemann, Gregory/J-9517-2013\",\"Obbard, Martyn/0000-0003-2064-0155\",\"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC); Killam Trusts; Polar Continental Shelf Project; Canadian Wildlife Service; Northern Scientific Training Program; Dr. Patrick Lett Student Bursary Fund; Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Wildlife Management Board; Fisheries and Oceans Canada; Churchill Northern Studies Centre; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Nunavut Dept of Environment; Makivik Corporation; Ontario Parks; Safari Club International (Ontario and Detroit Chapters); Les Brasseurs du Nord; La Fondation de la Faune du Quebec; La Societe de la faune et des parcs du Quebec; OMNR's Climate Change Program [CC-03/04-010]\",\"We are grateful to the Inuit hunters of Nunavut for collecting samples from harvested marine mammals.

When assessing the sustainability of power generation from biomass, it is important to consider the supply chain of the used biofuel by conducting a life cycle assessment of the system. Besides regular sustainability assessments, such as the calculation of the environmental sustainability, attention should be paid to exergy losses, i.e. the loss of 'energy quality', caused by the system as a whole, because every process and activity is accompanied with the loss of exergy and because the amount of exergy on earth can only be replenished by capturing new exergy from solar and tidal energy. This research compares the use of livestock manure and verge grass for power generation by assessing the systems from an environmental as well as an exergetic life cycle point of view. The assessed systems are the following: combustion of bioethanol from the fermentation of verge grass, combustion of substitute natural gas from anaerobic digestion of cow and pig manure and combustion of substitute natural gas from supercritical water gasification of cow and pig manure. The environmental sustainability is assessed by calculating ReCiPe endpoint indicators and the exergetic sustainability is assessed by applying the relatively new Total Cumulative Exergy Loss (TCExL) method. The TCExL method considers all exergy losses caused by a technological system during its life cycle, i.e. the internal exergy loss caused by the conversion of materials and energy, the abatement of emissions and the exergy loss related to land use. In addition to comparing the three systems as well as both assessment methods, the influence of taking into account the system's by-products as 'avoided products' and via 'allocation' on the assessment results is investigated. The bioethanol system appears more sustainable from an environmental sustainability point of view, while the bioethanol and supercritical water gasification systems are preferred from an exergetic sustainability point of view. The indicator of the environmental sustainability assessment is highly influenced by the way of taking into account by-products, while the exergetic sustainability indicator is not.

The notion of ES is also seen to aid us in saying something about how and what people value in nature. It is hence surprising that among a huge number of scientific works couched in terms in ES, still relatively few explore the explicit engagement of such concepts with stakeholders with respect to empirical issues, including integration. Motivated by a need to empirically test rather than assume the integrative work of ES, we ask: what ways of using the framework as a stakeholder tool are invited, and does integration unfold in practice? Our evidence comes from a study of a group of stakeholders' perspectives on sustainable management of sheep grazing in low alpine landscapes in the south of Norway. According to the stakeholders, grazing intensity, type and spatiality cannot be understood and arrived at without accounting for how grazing pressure is the result of the co-production of nature and society. By way of four empirical examples, we demonstrate 1) the integrative agency ES can have, 2) how ES can work to integrate despite the framework, 3) how ES can work against integration, and 4) the implicit agency of ES for the co-production of sustainability and grazing pressures. The study demonstrates that there are particular weaknesses in the concept as an integrative device regarding the invisibility of human co-agency. Furthermore, the precise methodological framing of the research is found to be crucial for whether and how human co-agency is made visible through the framework, and thus how ES works as an integrative framework.\",\"[Setten, Gunhild] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geog, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Brown, Katrina Myrvang] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland\",\"Setten, G (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geog, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.\",gunhild.setten@ntnu.no; katrina.brown@hutton.ac.uk,,,Research Council of Norway [212897/E40],\"We are very grateful to all workshop participants.

We apply this methodology to conduct a case study of community-based pond aquaculture on the island of Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. This diagnostic approach demonstrates how sustainability challenges are interrelated at multiple levels through an analysis applying common-pool resource (CPR) and collective action theories. At the community level, qualitative data show how pond aquaculture systems can have CPR dilemmas, requiring communities to work together to solve them. We show how a provision dilemma manifests from the need to maintain common canal infrastructure to distribute water to private ponds. Asymmetric incentives to contribute exist because there are up and downstream users in the pond network, similar to some irrigation systems. Second, at the level of individual ponds, we developed indicators for the Resource System, Resource Unit, Governance and Actor tiers of the SES framework. Indicator data for each pond was measured and transformed into normalized quantitative scores to examine the relationships between social and ecological outcomes within and between ponds. We combine the results of our multi-level analysis to discuss the broader social-ecological relationships which link collective action challenges in managing common canal infrastructure with pond level outcomes and current government policies for advancing community development. We emphasize the need for increased knowledge and training on effective aquaculture practice as an underlying driver of current system conditions. This study raises many methodological challenges associated with designing empirically based SES research and building SES theory. We discuss challenges with integrating diverse data types, indicator selection and making normative assumptions about sustainability.\",\"[Partelow, Stefan; Senff, Paula; Schlueter, Achim] Jacobs Univ, Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res ZMT, Bremen, Germany; [Buhari, Nurliah] Univ Mataram, Mataram, Indonesia\",\"Partelow, S (reprint author), Jacobs Univ, Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res ZMT, Bremen, Germany.\",stefan.partelow@leibniz-zmt.de; paula.senff@leibniz-zmt.de; nurliah.buhari@unram.ac.id; achim.schlueter@leibniz-zmt.de,,,Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research (ZMT),\"This research was funded by the Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research (ZMT).

We draw attention to the differences between this approach and the traditional disease-based approach, showing that the structural approach is centered on health systems, reinforces global governance, and embodies the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), thus taking on a multi-sectoral dimension. This approach leverages the maximum potential of international cooperation by establishing structuring networks and promoting relations between partner countries through their national health institutions, schools of public health, and technical staff. By way of example, we show that this approach is applied in the Union of South American Nations (UNASUL, acronym in Portuguese) and Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP, acronym in Portuguese), especially in Africa. Finally, we underline the importance of this approach for South-South relations, where it addresses the real necessities of partner countries, unlike North-South cooperation that is characterized by power asymmetries, especially within the economic and technical-scientific dimensions.\",\"[Ferreira, Jose Roberto; Fonseca, Luiz Eduardo] Fiocruz MS, Ctr Relacoes Int Saude, Av Brasil 4365, BR-21040900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil\",\"Ferreira, JR (reprint author), Fiocruz MS, Ctr Relacoes Int Saude, Av Brasil 4365, BR-21040900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.\",jose.roberto@fiocruz.br,,,,,,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,ABRASCO,RIO DE JANEIRO,\"RUA HESPERIA, 16-PARTE MANGUINHOS, RIO DE JANEIRO, 21050-040, BRAZIL\",1413-8123,1678-4561,,CIENC SAUDE COLETIVA,Cienc.

Both natural faults and stimulated fractures in enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) are difficult to image and map by seismic methods because hot brine filling the fractures and faults does not create a strong seismic property contrast relative to surrounding rock. We investigate here the technical feasibility of using supercritical CO2 (scCO(2)) injection into faults in a single-well push-pull scenario to characterize the hydraulic properties of the fault zone by emplacing scCO(2) that can serve as a contrast fluid for seismic monitoring. We develop a conceptual and numerical reservoir model of two intersecting faults based on the Dixie Valley geothermal system in Nevada, USA. The 2D conceptual model consists of a system with a main fault and an intersecting conjugate fault. The corresponding numerical model is discretized using irregular grid blocks with fine discretization around the slip plane, gouge, and damage zones. We perform forward modeling along with sensitivity and data-worth analyses of scCO(2) push-pull to investigate the CO2 distribution in the fault gouge during 30 days of push (injection) and 30 days of pull (production). Formal sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the most controlling unknown parameters in the fault zones. Using the selected set of unknown parameters and output responses, we perform data-worth analysis to reveal the most valuable output response to be measured for the best prediction of CO2 distribution in the fault zones and its uncertainty. From the results of data-worth analysis, we determine the optimal properties to target in monitoring, their locations, and the minimum observation time. Our results provide information on the optimal design of scCO(2) push-pull testing in a conjugate fault system modeled after Dixie Valley that can be used to enhance monitoring by active seismic and well-logging methods to better characterize the transmissive fault(s).\",\"[Lee, Kyung Jae; Oldenburg, Curtis M.; Doughty, Christine; Jung, Yoojin; Borgia, Andrea; Pan, Lehua; Daley, Thomas M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Geosci Div 74 316C, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhang, Rui] Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA; [Altundas, Bilgin; Chugunov, Nikita] Schlumberger Doll Res Ctr, Cambridge, MA USA\",\"Lee, KJ (reprint author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Geosci Div 74 316C, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.\",KyungJaeLee@lbl.gov,\"Pan, Lehua/G-2439-2015\",\"Zhang, Rui/0000-0001-8424-8254\",\"Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Geothermal Technologies Office, U.S. Department of Energy; Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy (DOE), Office of Coal and Power Systems, through the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; EDRA\",\"This work was supported by the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Geothermal Technologies Office, U.S. Department of Energy, and additionally supported by the Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy (DOE), Office of Coal and Power Systems, through the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under Department of Energy Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231, and by EDRA.

Little is known, however, about geographic variations in sleep and the role of individual-level and neighbourhood-level factors. Methods We used a multilevel modelling approach to quantify neighbourhood variation in self-reported sleep duration (very short <5 h; short 5-6.9 h; normative 7-8.9 h; long >= 9 h) among 3591 participants of the Boston Area Community Health Survey. We determined whether geographic variations persisted with control for individual-level demographic, socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle factors. We then determined the role of neighbourhood SES (nSES) in geographic variations. Additional models considered individual health factors. Results Between neighbourhood differences accounted for a substantial portion of total variability in sleep duration. Neighbourhood variation persisted with control for demographics, SES and lifestyle factors. These characteristics accounted for a portion (6-20%) of between-neighbourhood variance in very short, short and long sleep, while nSES accounted for the majority of the remaining between-neighbourhood variances. Low and medium nSES were associated with very short and short sleep (eg, very short sleep OR=2.08; 95% CI 1.38 to 3.14 for low vs high nSES), but not long sleep. Further inclusion of health factors did not appreciably increase the amount of between-neighbourhood variance explained nor did it alter associations. Conclusions Sleep duration varied by neighbourhood in a diverse urban setting in the northeastern USA. Individual-level demographics, SES and lifestyle factors explained some geographic variability, while nSES explained a substantial amount. Mechanisms associated with nSES should be examined in future studies to help understand and reduce geographic variations in sleep.\",\"[Fang, Shona C.; Piccolo, Rebecca; Yang, May; Araujo, Andre B.] New England Res Inst Inc, Watertown, MA 02172 USA; [Fang, Shona C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Subramanian, S.

This paper aims at highlighting the effects of migration upon the economic development of EU Member State receiving countries, starting from economic and social facts indicating a migration phenomenon that is ever increasing. In this regard, it has been thought appropriate to perform an analysis on how the migration phenomenon is perceived and an empirical study on the economic impact of migration on receiving countries of the European Union. Thus, a linear model has been used with panel data with specific fixed effects for cross section units, and the database has been made up of the values recorded for GDP per capita influence factors in the 28 EU Member States in the period 2008-2014. The results show that migration has positive effects upon economic development.

We consider the disease transmission dynamics within a healthcare facility and between the healthcare facility and its community. The focus of this study is to quantify the roles of the healthcare workers at and visitors to this healthcare facility in shaping the transmission dynamics during a disease outbreak. We stratify the total population into the general population in the community and the healthcare workers and visitors in the healthcare facility, to account for nosocomial transmission in the case when an individual in the community may be exposed to an infection due to a visit to the healthcare facility. Equilibrium stability analysis is carried out to inform long-term outcomes of disease dynamics in the coupled community-health care facility system. The basic reproduction number is calculated and its dependence on the waiting time and various disease transmission rates is analyzed. Numerical simulations are performed with pertussis as the disease in question. The results show that waiting time only affects the peak number of infections in the waiting reception area. The results also indicate that transmission rate of infective residents in the community and the transmission rate of the infective visitors at the healthcare facility have decisive impact on disease eradication/persistence of the coupled system; while other modes of transmissions are less important, affecting the peak number of infections at best.

This research informs the development of a relational framework based on stakeholder perspectives. It is grounded in an action research project with practitioners, and draws on a previous literature review, to present the underpinning elements of quality relationships as statements, organised under the headings of integrity, respect, fairness, compassion and trust. Using Q methodology, 27 participants, comprising a range of stakeholders (staff, residents, family and service providers), rank-ordered 48 statements based on perceptions of the importance of differing aspects of relationships. By-person factor analysis was used to create five factors or viewpoints by comparing and contrasting using the composite rankings alongside interview data collected for each participant. The first view 'Altogether now' prioritises compassionate engagement. Second, 'Respect is a two-way street' emphasises the need for reciprocal respect and recognition of history. The factor labelled 'Free spirits' posits the dominant view of freedom. The fourth view 'Families ... strengths and challenges' focuses on the necessary and complex involvement of families and finally, 'Helping hands' emphasises the role of relationships in increasing previously low expectations of social integration for previously isolated residents.

What participation entails and how children's right to participate can be ensured in different contexts is, however, richly debated. In this study, we critically explore the narratives of six youth with ethnic minority backgrounds who had experienced out-of-home placements in Norway. We were interested in how youth narrated their agency (motives and strategies) as well as how structural arrangements enabled and limited their participation, before and during placement. Nancy Fraser's conceptualization of parity in participation and social justice directed our gaze towards the interplay between normative and economic structures in the child welfare service (CWS) context. We identified a pattern along three narrative themes: a) narrating participation, b) narrating ambiguous participation and c) narrating non-participation. The analysis unpacked how informants negotiated both normative and economic structures encountering CWS. Successful negotiation entailed constructing a credible story through striking a balance between maturity and vulnerability and thus performing as \"\"a competent child\"\". Subsequently, informants who did not succeed in articulating their experiences and wishes in a credible way risked being marginalized as participants. Participation in decision making during placement was constructed as particularly precarious. Embedded cultural ideas of how \"\"a competent child\"\" should perform could be at odds with informants' identities. Ethnic minority youth might therefore struggle particularly hard to make themselves accountable within the normative structures of CWS. Youth participation also hinged on adults' ability and willingness to listen, and to take into account as well as act upon youths' concerns. However, case trajectories, bureaucratic characterizations and limited resources could hamper both the continuity and quality of such relationships. A key implication is an urgent need for theory and practice models that allow for how social categories such as ethnicity influence youth's participatory opportunities.\",\"[Fylkesnes, Marte Knag; Iversen, Anette Christine] Univ Bergen, Dept Hlth Promot & Dev, Christiesgate 13, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Taylor, Julie] Univ Birmingham, Sch Nursing, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England\",\"Fylkesnes, MK (reprint author), Univ Bergen, Dept Hlth Promot & Dev, Christiesgate 13, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.\",Marte.Fylkesnes@uni.no; j.taylor.1@bham.ac.uk; Anette.Iversen@uib.no,,,,,,46.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,\"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND\",0190-7409,1873-7765,,CHILD YOUTH SERV REV,Child.

It aims at reducing poverty and soil degradation in this region, taking into account the effects of desertification and climate change on sustainability of livelihoods. Design/methodology/approach - Several desertification attenuation projects in Nigeria are employing different methods for maximum benefits obtainable from the objectives of the particular projects. As noted above, however, the approach of GGW is to improve the alternative livelihoods of the people by their active participating in the implementation of the project. It is also noted that environmental impact assessment, community reconnaissance or needs assessments might be initial part of pre-project activities, thereby making the communities more aware and educated of the impending environmental problems. Findings - Desertification has reached an alarming state in Nigeria. The frontline desert threatened States of Nigeria constitute 43 percent of the land mass of the country. With increased pressure of desertification, exacerbated by a period of prolonged drought of more than 20 years, climate change and human activities, it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain sustainability in the management of the fragile lands and the region's ecosystem. Strategic interventions in combating the problem of desertification in Nigeria have attenuated some of the detrimental social, economic and environmental impacts on the affected communities. Programmes and projects have strengthened the resilience of the people, participating in sand dune stabilization, the Great Green Wall Sahara Sahel Initiative, including shelterbelt developments. Government has sustained inputs in environmentally friendly agriculture and also encouraged synergetic collaborative activities with international and national NGOs, international agencies and local institutions. Originality/value - These results/activities give evidence of the increased public awareness of environmental degradation due to desertification and climate change in Nigeria; the realization in environmental stabilization needs with ready participation of the communities for improved livelihoods in environmental activities and arid agriculture as supported by the National Great Green Wall (NAGGW) program of the country; resulting in internalization of these projects supporting livelihoods for sustainability in the Sahel of Nigeria.\",\"[Gadzama, Njidda Mamadu] Univ Maiduguri, Ctr Biotechnol, Maiduguri, Nigeria\",\"Gadzama, NM (reprint author), Univ Maiduguri, Ctr Biotechnol, Maiduguri, Nigeria.\",njiddagadzama@gmail.com,,,UN (GEF Trust Fund),\"Financial support for the GGW is both national and international with initial grant amount of US$108.8 million by the UN (GEF Trust Fund).

The extensive hydrogeomorphic effects from a wildfire can impair the ability of watersheds to provide safe drinking water to downstream communities and high-quality water to maintain riverine ecosystem health. Safeguarding water use for human activities and ecosystems is required for sustainable development; however, no global assessment of wildfire impacts on water supply is currently available. Here, we provide the first global evaluation of wildfire risks to water security, in the form of a spatially explicit index. We adapted the Driving forces-Pressure-State-Impact-Response risk analysis framework to select a comprehensive set of indicators of fire activity and water availability, which we then aggregated to a single index of wildfire-water risk using a simple additive weighted model. Our results show that water security in many regions of the world is potentially vulnerable, regardless of socio-economic status. However, in developing countries, a critical component of the risk is the lack of socio-economic capability to respond to disasters.

Traditional approaches to promoting healthy lifestyles have so far had limited success. Recently, co-creating public health interventions with end-users has been advocated to provide more effective and sustainable solutions. The aim of this study was to document and evaluate the co-creation of a public health intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour in older adults. Design: Community-dwelling older adults (N = 11, mean age = 74 years) and academic researchers attended 10 interactive co-creation workshops together. Setting: Workshops took place on university campus and the co-creators completed fieldwork tasks outside the workshops. Method: Workshops were informed by the Participatory and Appreciative Action and Reflection methodology. Data were collected using field notes, video recording and worksheet tasks. Analysis was conducted using a qualitative content analysis approach. Results: The co-creators developed a tailored intervention delivered through a mode congruent with older adults' lives. Key elements of the intervention included (1) education on sedentary behaviour, (2) resources to interrupt sedentary behaviour, (3) self-monitoring, (4) action planning and (5) evaluating the benefits of interrupting sedentary behaviour. Conclusion: Co-creation is a feasible approach to develop public health interventions; however, it is limited by the lack of a systematic framework to guide the process. Future work should aim to develop principles and recommendations to ensure co-creation can be conducted in a more scientific and reproducible way. The effectiveness and scalability of the intervention should be assessed.\",\"[Leask, Calum F.; Skelton, Dawn A.; Chastin, Sebastien F.

The cradle-to-gate life cycle inventory for chemical manufacturing is a detailed collection of the material and energy flows associated with a chemical's supply chain. Thus, there is a need to manage data describing both the lineage (or synthesis pathway) and processing conditions for a chemical. To this end, a Lineage ontology is proposed to reveal all the synthesis steps required to produce a chemical from raw materials, such as crude oil or biomaterials, while a Process ontology is developed to manage data describing the various unit processes associated with each synthesis step. The two ontologies are coupled such that process data, which is the basis for inventory modeling, is linked to lineage data through key concepts like the chemical reaction and reaction participants. To facilitate automated inventory modeling, a series of SPARQL queries, based on the concepts of ancestor and parent, are presented to generate a lineage for a chemical of interest from a set of reaction data. The proposed ontologies and SPARQL queries are evaluated and tested using a case study of nylon-6 production. Once a lineage is established, the process ontology can be used to guide inventory modeling based on both data mining (top-down) and simulation (bottom-up) approaches. The ability to generate a cradle-to-gate life cycle for a chemical represents a key achievement toward the ultimate goal of automated life cycle inventory modeling.\",\"[Mittal, Vinit K.] US EPA, ORISE, Off Res & Dev, 26 West Martin Luther King Dr, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA; [Bailin, Sidney C.] Knowledge Evolut Inc, 1748 Seaton St NW, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Gonzalez, Michael A.; Meyer, David E.; Barrett, William M.; Smith, Raymond L.] US EPA, Natl Risk Management Res Lab, 26 West Martin Luther King Dr, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA\",\"Smith, RL (reprint author), US EPA, Natl Risk Management Res Lab, 26 West Martin Luther King Dr, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA.\",smith.raymond@epa.gov,,,Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education [DW-89-92433001],\"This research was supported in part by an appointment of V.M. to the Postmasters Research Program at the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education through Interagency Agreement No. DW-89-92433001 between the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. EPA.\",,33.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,\"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA\",2168-0485,,,ACS SUSTAIN CHEM ENG,ACS Sustain.

It focuses on the study of the exchange of material and energy flows between a society and its environment for producing useful biomass. These flows must maintain the fund elements of the agroecosystem in sufficient quantity and of sufficient quality for them to continue providing ecosystem services. This methodology was applied to Spanish agriculture between 1960 and 2008, a period characterized by a deep process of intensification based on external inputs (EIs). We specifically focused on nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), carbon (C), and energy flows, and on the three fund elements that they sustain such as soil, biodiversity, and woodland. The results show that the growing incorporation of EIs has broken the equilibrium between land and biomass uses required by traditional farming, lowering the density of internal energy loops. On cropland, the relative fall in unharvested biomass had a negative effect on both biodiversity and the soil, which reduced the replenishment of organic C between 1960 and 1990. The sharp increase in internal and external flows of biomass for animal feed hardly contributed to increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) between 1990 and 2008 because of the fact that these flows had increasingly lower C:N ratios. The massive importation of N in feed and mineral fertilizers (553 and 1150 Gg in 2000, respectively) increased the surplus and the losses of N, which in turn could have a negative impact on biodiversity, water, and the atmosphere. The scenario constructed without imported animal feed would allow a reduction in the environmental impacts related to the excess of N, with hardly any negative effect on SOC replenishment, and improving energy return rates in the form of total, unharvested, and accumulated phytomass.\",\"[Guzman, Gloria I.; Aguilera, Eduardo; Torremocha, Eva; Soto-Fernandez, David; Infante-Amate, Juan; Gonzalez de Molina, Manuel] Univ Pablo Olavide Seville, Agroecosyst Hist Lab, Seville, Spain; [Garcia-Ruiz, Roberto] Univ Jaen, Ecol Unit, Dept Anim & Plant Biol & Ecol, Jaen, Spain\",\"Guzman, GI (reprint author), Univ Pablo Olavide Seville, Agroecosyst Hist Lab, Seville, Spain.\",,\"Aguilera, Eduardo/H-4864-2015\",\"Aguilera, Eduardo/0000-0003-4382-124X; Garcia-Ruiz, Roberto/0000-0001-9277-1993\",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [895-2011-1020]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Spain) [HAR2015-69620-C2-1-P],This work springs from the international research project Sustainable Farm Systems: Long-Term Socio-Ecological Metabolism in Western Agriculture funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC 895-2011-1020) and Spanish research project HAR2015-69620-C2-1-P funded by Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Spain).,,66.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,\"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA\",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

This manuscript describes outcomes from two pilot studies for Sustainability via Active Garden Education (SAGE), a program designed to increase PA and F&V consumption among 3 to 5 year old children. Methods: SAGE was developed using community-based participatory research (CBPR) and delivered to children (N= 89) in early care and education centers (ECEC, N = 6) in two US cities. Children participated in 12 one-hour sessions that included songs, games, and interactive learning activities involving garden maintenance and taste tests. We evaluated reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and potential for maintenance of SAGE following the RE-AIM framework. Reach was evaluated by comparing demographic characteristics among SAGE participants and residents of target geographic areas. Efficacy was evaluated with accelerometer-measured PA, F&V consumption, and eating in the absence of hunger among children, parenting practices regarding PA, and home availability of F&V. Adoption was evaluated by the number of ECEC that participated relative to the number of ECEC that were recruited. Implementation was evaluated by completion rates of planned SAGE lessons and activities, and potential for maintenance was evaluated with a parent satisfaction survey. Results: SAGE reached ECEC in neighborhoods representing a wide range of socioeconomic status, with participants' sociodemographic characteristics representing those of the intervention areas. Children significantly increased PA during SAGE lessons compared to usual lessons, but they also consumed more calories in the absence of hunger in post-vs. pre-intervention tests (both p <.05). Parent reports did not suggest changes in F&V consumption, parenting PA practices, or home F&V availability, possibly due to low parent engagement. ECEC had moderate-to-high implementation of SAGE lessons and curriculum. Potential for maintenance was strong, with parents rating SAGE favorably and reporting increases in knowledge about PA and nutrition guidelines for young children. Conclusions: SAGE successfully translated national PA guidelines to practice for young children but was less successful with nutrition guidelines. High adoption and implementation and favorable parent reports suggest high potential for program sustainability. Further work to engage parents and families of young children in ECEC-based PA and nutrition programming is needed.\",\"[Lee, Rebecca E.; Soltero, Erica G.] Arizona State Univ, Coll Nursing & Hlth Innovat, Ctr Hlth Promot & Dis Prevent, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA; [Parker, Nathan H.; Ledoux, Tracey A.] Univ Houston, Dept Hlth & Human Performance, Texas Obes Res Ctr, Houston, TX USA; [Mama, Scherezade K.] Penn State Univ, Dept Kinesiol, Coll Hlth & Human Dev, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [McNeill, Lorna] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Hlth Dispar Res, Houston, TX 77030 USA\",\"Lee, RE (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Coll Nursing & Hlth Innovat, Ctr Hlth Promot & Dis Prevent, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA.\",releephd@yahoo.com,,,National Institute of Child Health and Human Development of the National Institutes of Health [R21HD073685-01],\"This study was supported by a grant awarded to Dr. Lee from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development of the National Institutes of Health (R21HD073685-01).

Organic-carbon normalized distribution coefficients for these PAHs between sediments and pore waters decreased by more than two orders of magnitude with depth as well. To determine to what extent pore water dissolved and colloidal organic carbon (DOC) was responsible for the observed nonlinearity and decrease in K'(OC), a three-phase model was used to estimate pore-water PAH-DOC binding coefficients (K-DOC). Partitioning of PAHs to pore-water DOC (i.e., K-DOC) enhances the observed \"\"dissolved\"\" phase PAH concentration, especially for high-K-OW compounds, contributing to the nonlinearity in K'(OC)-K-OW plots. However, our application of the three-phase partitioning model to these data indicate that, at most, pore-water PAH-DOC binding accounts for one order of magnitude of the observed decrease in K'(OC) with depth in the sediment bed. The results of this study are consistent with three-phase partitioning theory for hydrophobic organic compounds between sediment organic matter, pore-water DOC, and freely dissolved aqueous phases in natural systems.\",\"Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Inst Earth & Ecosyst Sci, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Dept Phys Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA\",\"Mitra, S (reprint author), Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Inst Earth & Ecosyst Sci, 310 Dinwiddie Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.\",smitra@mailhost.tcs.tulane.edu,,,,,,24.0,34.0,41.0,1.0,19.0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,\"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA\",0730-7268,1552-8618,,ENVIRON TOXICOL CHEM,Environ.

A simulation model is developed under Microsoft ExcelTM (Microsoft Corporation, Washington, US) to reproduce the flow of returnable transport items (RTIs) in the CLSC and to compute the corresponding environmental impact. Multi-objective optimization, including some relevant environmental key performance indicators (KPIs), is then carried out exploiting the commercial software ModeFRONTIERTM (ESTECO S.p.A., Trieste, Italy), to determine the settings that minimize emissions of the CLSC. In addition, economic and strategic metrics are taken into account in the optimization, to make the analysis more comprehensive. Three scenarios are considered (one \"\"base\"\" scenario and two scenarios examined in a sensitivity analysis) with different relative importance assigned to the metrics subject to optimization. Results show that the asset retrieving operations contribute to the environmental impact of the system to the greatest extent, mainly because of the quite relevant distance between Company A and its customers. Conversely, emissions due to the purchase of new assets contribute to the total environmental impact of the system to a very limited extent. Because the analysis is grounded on a real CLSC, the results are expected to provide practical indications to logistics and supply chain managers, to minimize the environmental performance of the system.\",\"[Bottani, Eleonora; Casella, Giorgia] Univ Parma, Dept Engn & Architecture, Viale GP Usberti 181-A, I-43124 Parma, Italy\",\"Bottani, E (reprint author), Univ Parma, Dept Engn & Architecture, Viale GP Usberti 181-A, I-43124 Parma, Italy.\",eleonora.bottani@unipr.it; giorgia.casella@studenti.unipr.it,,\"CASELLA, GIORGIA/0000-0003-4137-3084\",Italian Ministry of University and Research under the SIR (Scientific Independence of young Researchers);  [D92115000210008];  [RBSI14L97M],\"This research was supported by the research Grant No. D92115000210008 (project code RBSI14L97M), called \"\"ESCALATE Economic and Environmental Sustainability of Supply Chain and Logistics with Advanced Technologies\"\", funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research under the SIR (Scientific Independence of young Researchers) 2014 program (decree of 23 January 2014, No. 197) and awarded to the first author.\",,48.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,MDPI AG,BASEL,\"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND\",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2018.0,10,2,,,,,,,329,10.3390/su10020329,,,,20.0,GREEN & SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FX3BB,WOS:000425943100052,,gold,,,2018-09-20\n",

Many of the current energy related policies have their focus on new buildings but, due to the low rates of replacement of the existing building stock, it is crucial that the low energy performances of these buildings are improved. Most of these buildings, due to design and construction constraints, may not be able to reach the new energy efficiency standards, which many times involve complex construction works. Nevertheless, the achievement of significant reductions in energy consumption and carbon emissions may not always require a highly efficient solution for the envelope. Other solutions, combining energy efficiency measures and the use of renewable energy, are also possible. In this context, the key research problem addressed in Annex 56 was to understand how far it is possible to go with energy conservation and efficiency measures and from which point the measures to foster renewable energy use become more economical taking into account the local context and the many restrictions the existing buildings face. Thus, a new methodology was developed to be used in the decision making process for energy related building renovation, allowing to find a cost-effective balance between energy consumption, carbon emissions and overall added value achieved in the renovation process. The methodology developed within IEA EBC Annex 56 project aims at defining, assessing and comparing energy renovation activities in a cost-effective way, optimizing the energy use and the carbon emissions reduction, mainly in residential buildings but also in non-residential buildings without complex HVAC technologies. The methodology explores the full range of cost-effective reduction of carbon emissions and energy use and takes into account also the additional benefits and the overall added value achieved by the building within the renovation process.

Several physicochemical variables (especially pH, major cations, dissolved organic carbon, and dissolved metal concentrations) must, however, be assigned to run the BLM, but they are highly variable in time and space in natural systems. This article describes probabilistic approaches for integrating such variability during the derivation of risk indexes. To describe each variable using a probability density function (PDF), several methods were combined to 1) treat censored data (i.e., data below the limit of detection), 2) incorporate the uncertainty of the solid-to-liquid partitioning of metals, and 3) detect outliers. From a probabilistic perspective, 2 alternative approaches that are based on log-normal and G distributions were tested to estimate the probability of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) exceeding the predicted non-effect concentration (PNEC), i.e., p(PEC/PNEC > 1). The probabilistic approach was tested on 4 real-case studies based on Cu-related data collected from stations on the Loire and Moselle rivers. The approach described in this article is based on BLM tools that are freely available for end-users (i. e., the Bio-Met software) and on accessible statistical data treatments. This approach could be used by stakeholders who are involved in risk assessments of metals for improving site-specific studies. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2013; 9: 508-516.

One method of choice is lifecycle assessment (LCA), which takes a fuel product system as its object of analysis. LCA uses a static system model, with carbon flows averaged over a defined \"\"lifecycle\"\". Although it may evaluate some carbon stock changes, the LCA convention of treating biogenic CO2 emissions as fully offset by the carbon embodied in a biofuel's feedstock renders its results independent of the dominant portion of carbon uptake on the land from which the feedstock is sourced. An application of material flow analysis termed annual basis carbon (ABC) accounting captures system dynamics and is fully sensitive to changes in carbon uptake. This paper compares the LCA and ABC methods, and contrasts their respective results for a case study of real-world biofuel production. It highlights the large impact of baseline carbon uptake, which can affect the sign of the results from either a likely decrease or a likely increase in net CO2 emissions even before considering economically-induced effects. Implications include the need for further methodological work, new program-scale model development, an empirical re-analysis of biofuel systems, and a reconsideration of existing public policies and research priorities.\",\"[DeCicco, John M.] Univ Michigan, Energy Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA\",\"DeCicco, JM (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Energy Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.\",DeCicco@umich.edu,,,University of Michigan Energy Institute,Funding for this work was provided by the University of Michigan Energy Institute.

Despite considerable data on the distribution of dams and their hydrological effects on river systems, there are few expansive and long analyses of impacts on freshwater biota. We investigated trends in waterbird communities over 32years, (1983-2014), at three spatial scales in two similarly sized large river basins, with contrasting levels of water resource development, representing almost a third (29%) of Australia: the Murray-Darling Basin and the Lake Eyre Basin. The Murray-Darling Basin is Australia's most developed river basin (240 dams storing 29,893GL) while the Lake Eyre Basin is one of the less developed basins (1 dam storing 14GL). We compared the long-term responses of waterbird communities in the two river basins at river basin, catchment and major wetland scales. Waterbird abundances were strongly related to river flows and rainfall. For the developed Murray-Darling Basin, we identified significant long-term declines in total abundances, functional response groups (e.g., piscivores) and individual species of waterbird (n=50), associated with reductions in cumulative annual flow. These trends indicated ecosystem level changes. Contrastingly, we found no evidence of waterbird declines in the undeveloped Lake Eyre Basin. We also modelled the effects of the Australian Government buying up water rights and returning these to the riverine environment, at a substantial cost (>3.1AUD billion) which were projected to partly (18% improvement) restore waterbird abundances, but projected climate change effects could reduce these benefits considerably to only a 1% or 4% improvement, with respective annual recovery of environmental flows of 2,800GL or 3,200GL. Our unique large temporal and spatial scale analyses demonstrated severe long-term ecological impact of water resource development on prominent freshwater animals, with implications for global management of water resources.\",\"[Kingsford, Richard T.; Bino, Gilad; Porter, John L.] UNSW Australia, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Porter, John L.] New South Wales Off Environm & Heritage, Hurstville, NSW, Australia\",\"Kingsford, RT (reprint author), UNSW Australia, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\",richard.kingsford@unsw.edu.au,,,Queensland Department of Environment Protection and Heritage; New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage; Victoria Department of Environment and Primary Industry; South Australia Department of Environment and Natural Resources; Australian Department of Environment,Queensland Department of Environment Protection and Heritage; New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage; Victoria Department of Environment and Primary Industry; South Australia Department of Environment and Natural Resources; Australian Department of Environment,,69.0,2.0,2.0,12.0,30.0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,\"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA\",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The key parameters and their respective effects have been fully considered. Such key parameters include plant type, fuel type, fuel transportation, emissions for fuel extraction and processing, within-facility power consumption at the power plant, degradation rate, site ambient conditions, and losses related to transmission and distribution. The proposed model has two significant features. The first feature considers a framework that generates a dynamic model. The time span in the dynamic framework is flexible and can vary from 1 s to the entire functional life of a power plant. The second feature of the model (representing its comprehensiveness) considers the aforementioned nine key parameters, holistically and simultaneously. Applying the proposed model across a wide range of circumstances leads to the estimation of the quantitative effect of each parameter. This shows the priority of order that the parameters should be given when designing a low-emission fossil-fuel power plant. Among the different standard cases of plant designs discussed in this paper, combined-cycle power plants running on natural gas have the minimum carbon footprint. Hence, the power plant and fuel types have the greatest effect on carbon footprint per unit of generated electrical power. Moreover, other mentioned parameters demonstrate significant effect on the results in this research work. The variation of parameters from least to most can result in a four-fold increase in carbon footprint. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We provide a comprehensive dynamic assessment index system for WRCI, which is composed of three primary indicators (natural endowment, exploitation and utilization degree, exploitation and utilization efficiency of water resources) and nine secondary indicators. After ascertaining the thresholds and grading standards for each specific indicator and their integrated indexes according to the experience of developed countries and regions, we employ an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model reformed by entropy technology to calculate their weights, and establish a multi objective fuzzy membership function to calculate the normalized values. Subsequently, we use the statistical data of 51 prefecture level regions in Northwest China during 2000-2014 to analyze the spatiotemporal changes of WRCI and its primary and secondary indicators. The results show that WRCI in the whole region of Northwest China belonged to the less strong or weak constraint type during the period. However, Northwest China was confronted with great disparity in human-water relationship according to the temporal and spatial changes of WRCI and its primary and secondary indicators. About 1/3 of prefecture level regions belonged to the strong and very strong constraint type. About 1/3 belonged to the less strong constraint type. Only about 1/3 belonged to the weak and very weak constraint type. The framework provides a relatively absolute evaluation of the conflict degree between the human-water systems. It might help to scientifically understand the spatiotemporal features of the relationship between water scarcity and human activities for Northwest China, and also has the potential for application in other areas and scales for monitoring and comparison purposes in space and over time.\",\"[Bao, Chao; Zou, Jianjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resource Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Bao, Chao; Zou, Jianjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Reg Sustainable Dev Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Bao, Chao; Zou, Jianjun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China\",\"Bao, C (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resource Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.\",baoc@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571156]; Major Projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41590844]; Service Project on the Cultivation and Construction for the Characteristic Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [TSYJS02],\"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number: 41571156), the Major Projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number: 41590844), and the Service Project on the Cultivation and Construction for the Characteristic Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant number: TSYJS02).

Methods The Global Plan to Stop TB, 2006-2015 was developed by the Stop TB Partnership. It sets out what needs to be done to achieve the 2015 targets for global TB control, based on WHO's Stop TB Strategy. Plan costs were estimated using spreadsheet models that included epidemiological, demographic, planning and unit cost data. Findings A total of US$ 56 billion is required during the period 2006-2015 (93% for TB-endemic countries, 7% for international technical agencies), increasing from US$ 3.5 billion in 2006 to US$ 6.7 billion in 2015. The single biggest cost (US$ 3 billion per year) is for the treatment of drug-susceptible cases in DOTS programmes. Other major costs are treatment of patients with multi- and extensively drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB and XDR-TB), collaborative TB/HIV activities, and advocacy, communication and social mobilization. Low-income countries account for 41% of total funding needs and 65% of funding needs for TB/HIV. Middle-income countries account for 72% of the funding needed for treatment of MDR-TB and XDR-TB. African countries require the largest increases in funding. Conclusion Achieving the 2015 global targets set for TB control requires a major increase in funding. To support resource mobilization, comprehensive and costed national plans that are in line with the Global Plan to Stop TB are needed, backed up by robust assessments of the funding that can be raised in each country from domestic sources and the balance that is needed from donors.\",\"[Floyd, Katherine; Pantoja, Andrea] WHO, Stop TB Dept, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland\",\"Floyd, K (reprint author), WHO, Stop TB Dept, 20 Ave Appia, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland.\",floydk@who.int,,,,,,28.0,23.0,25.0,0.0,8.0,WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION,GENEVA 27,\"MARKETING AND DISSEMINATION, CH-1211 GENEVA 27, SWITZERLAND\",0042-9686,1564-0604,,B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN,Bull.

Also, cryptic sibling species often become specialized to different ecological conditions, for instance, with host specialization by cryptic parasite species. The fungus Microbotryum violaceum causes anther smut disease in plants of Caryophyllaceae, and the degree of specialization and gene flow between strains on different hosts have been controversial in the literature. We conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses on M. violaceum from 23 host species and different geographic origins using three single-copy nuclear genes (beta-tub, gamma-tub, and Ef1 alpha). Congruence between the phylogenies identified several lineages that evolved independently for a long time. The lineages had overlapping geographic ranges but were highly specialized on different hosts. These results thus suggest that M. violaceum is a complex of highly specialized sibling species. Two incongruencies between the individual gene phylogenies and one intragene recombination event were detected at basal nodes, suggesting ancient introgression events or speciation events via hybridizations. However, incongruencies and recombination were not detected among terminal branches, indicating that the potentials for cross-infection and experimental hybridization are often not sufficient to suggest that introgressions would likely persist in nature.\",\"Amherst Coll, Dept Biol, Amherst, MA 01002 USA; INRA, PMDV, F-78026 Versailles, France; Univ Paris 11, ENGREF, CNRS, UMR 8079, F-91405 Orsay, France\",\"Le Gac, M (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.\",legac@zoology.ubc.ca; MHood@amherst.edu; efournie@versailles.inra.fr; tatiana.giraud@u-psud.fr,,\"Giraud, Tatiana/0000-0002-2685-6478\",,,,59.0,135.0,138.0,2.0,23.0,SOC STUDY EVOLUTION,LAWRENCE,\"810 E 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA\",0014-3820,,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,JAN,2007.0,61,1,,,,,15,26,,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00002.x,,,,12.0,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,137HZ,WOS:000244285000003,17300424.0,gold_or_bronze,,,2018-07-03\n",

Public transit system, as an integral part of multimodal transportation ecosystem, has been supporting such shift by exploring the adoption of electric vehicles. In recent years, the advancement in Battery Electric Buses (BEBs) and their supporting infrastructure technology made them a viable replacement for diesel and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) buses. Yet, it remains a challenge on how to optimally deploy the BEB system due to its unique spatio-temporal characteristics. To fill this gap, this research introduces a spatio-temporal optimization model to identify the optimal deployment strategies for BEB system. The identified spatio-temporal deployment of BEB system can minimize the cost associated with vehicle procurement and charging station allocation, while satisfying transit operation constraints such as maintaining existing bus operation routes and schedules. The proposed method is implemented onto the transit network operated by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) to showcase its effectiveness. As many transit agencies are testing electric buses and considering the integration of electric buses into future fleet, this research will help transit agencies make informed decisions regarding strategic planning and design of BEB systems.\",\"[Wei, Ran] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Geospatial Sci, Sch Publ Policy, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Liu, Xiaoyue; Fayyaz, S.

Natural populations deliver a wide range of products that provide income for millions of people and need to be exploited sustainably. Large heterogeneity in individual performance within these exploited populations has the potential to improve population recovery after exploitation and thus help sustain yields over time. 2. We explored the potential of using individual heterogeneity to design smarter harvest schemes, by sparing individuals that contribute most to future productivity and population growth, using the understorey palm Chamaedorea elegans as a model system. Leaves of this palm are an important non-timber forest product and long-term inter-individual growth variability can be evaluated from internode lengths. 3. We studied a population of 830 individuals, half of which was subjected to a 67% defoliation treatment for 3years. We measured effects of defoliation on vital rates and leaf size-a trait that determines marketability. We constructed integral projection models in which vital rates depended on stem length, past growth rate and defoliation and evaluated transient population dynamics to quantify population development and leaf yield. We then simulated scenarios in which we spared individuals that were either most important for population growth or had leaves smaller than marketable size. 4. Individuals varying in size or past growth rate responded similar to leaf harvesting in terms of growth and reproduction. By contrast, a reduction in survival chance was smaller in large individuals than in small ones. Simulations showed that harvest-induced population decline was greatly reduced when sparing individuals from size and past growth classes that contributed most to population growth. Under this scenario, cumulative leaf harvest over 20years was somewhat reduced, but long-term leaf production was sustained. A threefold increase in leaf yield was generated when individuals with small leaves were spared. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates the potential to create smarter systems of palm leaf harvest by accounting for individual heterogeneity within exploited populations. Sparing individuals that contribute most to population growth ensured sustained leaf production over time. The concepts and methods presented here are generally applicable to exploited plant and animal species which exhibit considerable individual heterogeneity.\",\"[Jansen, Merel; Bongers, Frans; Zuidema, Pieter A.] Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Jansen, Merel; Anten, Niels P.

Recently, Afghanistan has, at one hand, experienced significant socio-economic changes through political and economic transformation and, on the other hand it is considered amongst vulnerable countries to climate and other natural changes. For this, understanding the interactions between socio-economic and natural changes with land use change under different development scenarios is crucial for sustainable land use management. Present research took Kabul River Basin (KRB) as a case study area and used Dynamic of Land System (DLS) model to simulate land use/cover for the years of 2020 and 2030. For this purpose, various socio-economic and bio-physical datasets were prepared and then integrated into the model under three different scenarios i.e. baseline, economic development, and environmental protection. The results indicated a significant land use change under all three scenarios. Cultivated land, grassland and built-up area will significantly increase under all three scenarios; while forest area, water area and unused land will significantly decrease under the economic development and baseline scenarios. While in the environmental protections scenario, the forest area will considerably increase, however, water area still showed a decreasing trend but it will be lesser as compared to the other two scenarios. By considering the above degradations, particularly under baseline and economic scenarios, it is suggested that the government needs to develop overall land use planning in KRB to achieve a rational exploitation of land resources and we hoped that the results of this study will help to target management decisions on rational land uses and effective environment protections of KRB.

Thus, discussing the relationship between the livelihood assets and the livelihood strategies of farm households helps in understanding their livelihood conditions and in formulating reasonable poverty reduction policies. Taking Zunyi City, which is located in a western, mountainous area of China, as the study region and using the framework of sustainability analysis, this study first tries to establish the mechanism of the influence of farm household livelihood assets on livelihood strategies, then evaluates different farm household livelihood assets by establishing an evaluation index system for them, and finally conducts an empirical analysis on the influence of farm household livelihood assets on livelihood strategies using a multinomial logit model. The research results indicate the following: (1) natural assets and material assets have a significant negative influence on farm households' choice of livelihood strategies, that is, the more natural assets and material assets that farm households own, the more likely they are to choose livelihood strategies involving engaging in agricultural production; (2) Manpower assets and financial assets have a significant positive influence on farm households' choice of livelihood strategy, namely, the more manpower assets and financial assets that farm households own, the more likely they are to choose livelihood strategies involving engaging in non-agricultural production; (3) Social assets have no significant influence on farm households' choice of livelihood strategy.\",\"[Liu, Zhifei] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhifei; Chen, Qianru; Xie, Hualin] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Ecol Civilizat, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China\",\"Xie, HL (reprint author), Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Ecol Civilizat, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.\",liuzhifei1972@126.com; cqrjufe@163.com; xiehualin@jxufe.edu.cn,,\"Xie, Hualin/0000-0002-4951-4526\",\"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41561040]; Key projects of the National Social Science Fund of China [15AZD075]; Funding Project for Academic and Technical Leaders in Major Disciplines of Jiangxi Province [20172BCB22011]; Technology Foundation of Jiangxi Education Department of China [KJLD14033, GJJ160431]; Fok Ying-Tung Fund [141084]\",\"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41561040), the Key projects of the National Social Science Fund of China (No. 15AZD075), Funding Project for Academic and Technical Leaders in Major Disciplines of Jiangxi Province (20172BCB22011), the Technology Foundation of Jiangxi Education Department of China (No. KJLD14033 & No. GJJ160431) and the Fok Ying-Tung Fund (No. 141084).\",,17.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,MDPI,BASEL,\"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND\",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2018.0,10,3,,,,,,,875,10.3390/su10030875,,,,12.0,GREEN & SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA8DA,WOS:000428567100302,,gold,,,2018-07-06\n",

The effect of the Po River plume was observed at the western stations; in particular, the northernmost one (1306) showed the highest values of primary production, both as hourly peaks (up to 14 Mg C m(-3) h(-1)) and daily water column integrated values (up to 740 mg C m(-2) day(-1)), the southern station (C04) was only sporadically influenced and did not differ significantly from the easternmost ones (C 12 and B 13), where the lowest TPP values were recorded (around I Mg C m(-3) h(-1)). In this study the first in situ data are reported on short-term phytoplankton C extra cellular release in the Northern Adriatic Sea. At every station a considerable percentage of primary production (PER > 20% as an average, with peaks of up to 70%) was released as dissolved organic carbon. In particular, an association of fairly high PER (> 10%) and specific production (Pb > 10 mg C mg chl(-1) h(-1)) was observed from spring to summer, when the mucilage phenomenon usually starts. This result might suggest the presence of an uncoupling between photosynthesis and growth, probably related with nutrient availability, which would be responsible for a high production of extra cellular organic carbon. Phytoplankton primary production and bacterial carbon production were closely related and bacterial C production accounted, on average, for a higher percentage of primary production than the values typically reported in the literature on aquatic environments. The flow of organic matter from phytoplankton to bacteria seems to satisfy the bacterial carbon demand during most of the spring and summer, at least in the upper water layers. However, during the summer, there is evidence that BCD sometimes exceeds the amount of C produced by phytoplankton. Neither phytoplankton nor bacterial production showed significant differences over the relevant years, and their absolute values did not change when comparing periods with or without mucilage. However, there were indications of an uncoupling between phytoplankton photosynthesis and growth and of a shift from an autotrophic to a heterotrophic metabolism, especially during the spring and summer period when mucilage might occur.

An emergy decomposition analysis,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sustainable agriculture; Emergy; Decomposition analysis; Italian agriculture,ENERGY,\"The agricultural sector is critical for the achievement of sustainable development worldwide. Its present and future sustainability relies on the difficult balance of food production and environmental impact. The need for resource use optimization and increasing reliance on renewable energy, calls for increased development and integration of its supporting, provisioning, regulating and social services (multifunctionality) worldwide, in agreement with the global framework of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the European Union Objectives and other international assessment studies (e.g. the United Nations International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development). The performance of the Italian agricultural system is monitored and evaluated in this paper by means of the emergy accounting method coupled to decomposition analysis techniques, applied to a 25 year time series (1985-2010). The aim of this study is to assess the sustainability of these systems over time as well as to identify the major drivers of performance change, to serve as the basis for future policy scenarios. Two Italian regional agricultural systems (Emilia Romagna, in Northern Italy, and Campania, in Southern Italy) are selected as case studies representative of the Italian agriculture. Results show a steady decrease of cropped land, an increase of the fraction of renewable resource use, an overall increase of sustainability (expressed by emergy indicators) in both regions. The fraction of renewable emergy use increased from 14% to 21% in the Emilia Romagna region and from 23% to 27% in the Campania region, compared to the year 1985, with oscillating behavior over time. The overall Emergy Sustainability Index increased from 14% to 16% in the Emilia Romagna region and from 15% to 19% in the Campania region, recently. The results of decomposition analysis highlight the important role of land use change and labor productivity as major drivers of total emergy use in both agricultural systems. The approach applied in this paper is applicable to the study of other national and regional agricultural sectors wordwide, provided suitable time series of input and output flows are available.

The objective of this study is to forecast the food-related energy consumption and evaluate policy alternatives for reducing food related energy consumption in the medium and long term. Influential factors of energy consumption in the food industry include population growth rate, GDP, agriculture's share of GDP, food waste, technologies, and agricultural investment. Based on the life cycle of the food industry, five life stages were considered: agricultural production, industrial processing and packaging, transportation, wholesale and retail, and household. In this study, based on the causal relationships and feedback loops between these factors and the energy consumed for each life stage, a system dynamics (SD) model was designed to simulate the situation for the US food industry. Policy options of reducing waste percentage and improving industrial energy productivity are incorporated for building the energy use mitigation scenarios. By implementing the integrated mitigation scenarios, a 9.43% reduction in total food system energy consumption can be attained in 2030. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We present new radioecological understanding of the processes involved, such as the interaction of waterborne radionuclides with suspended particles and sediments or the biological uptake and turnover of radionuclides, which have been better quantified and mathematically described. We demonstrate that biokinetic models can better represent radionuclide transfer to biota in non-equilibrium situations, bringing more realism to predictions, especially when combining physical, chemical and biological interactions that occur in such an open and dynamic environment as the ocean. As a result, we are readier now than we were before the FDNPP accident in terms of having models that can be applied to dynamic situations. The paper concludes with our vision for marine radioecology as a fundamental research discipline and we present a strategy for our discipline at the European and international levels. The lessons learned are presented along with their possible applicability to assess/reduce the environmental consequences of future accidents to the marine environment and guidance for future research, as well as to assure the sustainability of marine radioecology. This guidance necessarily reflects on why and where further research funding is needed, signalling the way for future investigations. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Structured population models (e.g. integral projection models (IPMs)) are useful tools for linking vital rates to population dynamics. However, the application of such models to forest trees remains challenging owing to features of tree life cycles, such as slow growth, long lifespan and lack of data on crucial ontogenic stages. We developed a survival model that accounts for size-dependent mortality and a growth model that characterizes individual heterogeneity. We integrated vital rate models into two types of population model; an analytically tractable form of IPM and an individual-based model (IBM) that is applied with stochastic simulations. We calculated longevities, passage times to, and occupancy time in, different life cycle stages, important metrics for understanding how demographic rates translate into patterns of forest turnover and carbon residence times. Here, we illustrate the methods for three tropical forest species with varying life-forms. Population dynamics from IPMs and IBMs matched a 34 year time series of data (albeit a snapshot of the life cycle for canopy trees) and highlight differences in life-history strategies between species. Specifically, the greater variation in growth rates within the two canopy species suggests an ability to respond to available resources, which in turn manifests as faster passage times and greater occupancy times in larger size classes. The framework presented here offers a novel and accessible approach to modelling the population dynamics of forest trees.\",\"[Needham, Jessica; Chang-Yang, Chia-Hao; McMahon, Sean M.] Smithsonian Inst, Forest Global Earth Observ, Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, 647 Contees Wharf Rd, Edgewater, MD 21307 USA; [Merow, Cory] Yale Univ, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 165 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Caswell, Hal] Univ Amsterdam, IBED, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands\",\"Needham, J (reprint author), Smithsonian Inst, Forest Global Earth Observ, Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, 647 Contees Wharf Rd, Edgewater, MD 21307 USA.\",needhamj@si.edu,,\"Chang-Yang, Chia-Hao/0000-0003-3635-4946\",Clarendon Scholarship; New College Scholarship; BBSRC; USA National Science Foundation [NSF 640261];  [NSF DEB-1046113],\"This work formed part of J.N.'s PhD which was funded by a Clarendon Scholarship, a New College Scholarship and the BBSRC.

We tested thirteen materials on a model that was applied to retrofit a traditional rural building through roof's insulation. To evaluate the materials from the socio-economic and environmental viewpoints, we combined life cycle costing and assessment with an adaptive comfort evaluation. In this way, the performances of each coating material were measured in terms of an incurred reduction of costs and consumption of resources, maintenance of the cultural and historic significance of buildings, and a guaranteed indoor thermal comfort. The comprehensive assessment of the materials involved their assignment to one of the three preference-ordered sustainability classes. For this purpose, we used a multiple criteria decision analysis approach that accounted for preferences of a few tens of rural buildings' owners. The proposed methodological framework incorporated an outranking-based preference model to compare the insulating materials with the characteristic class profiles while using the weights derived from the revised Simos procedure. The initial sorting recommendation for each material was validated against the outcomes of robustness analysis that combined the preferences of individual stakeholders either at the output or at the input level. The analysis revealed that the most favorable materials in terms of their overall sustainability were glass wool, hemp fibres, kenaf fibres, polystyrene foam, polyurethane, and rock wool.\",\"[Kadzinski, Milosz; Miebs, Grzegorz] Poznan Univ Tech, Inst Comp Sci, Piotrowo 2, PL-60965 Poznan, Poland; [Rocchi, Lucia; Grohmann, David; Menconi, Maria Elena; Paolotti, Luisa] Univ Perugia, Dept Agr Food & Environm Sci, Borgo 20 Giungno 74, I-06121 Perugia, Italy\",\"Kadzinski, M (reprint author), Poznan Univ Tech, Inst Comp Sci, Piotrowo 2, PL-60965 Poznan, Poland.\",milosz.kadzinski@cs.put.poznan.pl,\"Kadzinski, Milosz/L-8304-2014\",\"Kadzinski, Milosz/0000-0003-1806-3715; Rocchi, Lucia/0000-0002-3386-2390; Menconi, MariaElena/0000-0002-5573-9107; Miebs, Grzegorz/0000-0002-0628-6949\",Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education under the Iuventus Plus program [IP2015 029674 - 0296/IP2/2016/74],The work of Milosz Kadzinski and Grzegorz Miebs was supported by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education under the Iuventus Plus program in 2016-2019 Grant Number IP2015 029674 - 0296/IP2/2016/74.,,70.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,6.0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,\"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS\",0926-2644,1572-9907,,GROUP DECIS NEGOT,Group Decis.

Although an increasing interest in sustainability is apparent within the global literature, empirical studies from within the European setting are few. The factors that influence sustainability are generally conceptualized at three levels: programme level, the immediate context and the wider environment. To-date attention has focused primarily on the former two. Using a community-based child injury prevention programme in England as an exemplar, this paper explores the concept of sustainability within the wider policy environment, and considers the impact of this on local programmes. Methods A content review of global and UK national public health policies (1981-2014) relevant to child safety was undertaken. Interviews were held with senior representatives of global and UK agencies involved in developing child safety policy. Results Forty-nine policies were reviewed. The term ` sustain', or its derivatives, featured in 36 (73%) of these. Its' use however, related primarily to conservation of resources rather than continued programme operation. Potential mechanisms for supporting programme sustainability featured within some documents; however, the approach to sustainability was inconsistent between policies and over time. Policy stakeholders identified programme sustainability as relevant to their core business, but its' conceptualization varied according to individual interpretation. Conclusions Programme sustainability is poorly addressed within global and UK-based public health policy. Strengthening a national and international policy focus on sustainability and incorporating sustainability into public health planning frameworks may create a more supportive environment for local programmes.\",\"[Errington, Gail] Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Baddiley Clark Bldg,Richardson Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4AX, Tyne & Wear, England; [Evans, Catrin; Watson, Michael C.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Hlth Sci, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Nottingham, England\",\"Errington, G (reprint author), Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Baddiley Clark Bldg,Richardson Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4AX, Tyne & Wear, England.\",gail.errington1@newcastle.ac.uk,,\"Evans, Catrin/0000-0002-5338-2191\",Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents; British Nuclear Fuels Limited.,\"This study was funded by a scholarship (2011-14) from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and British Nuclear Fuels Limited.

Optimization of these fast pyrolysis-based biofuel processes were investigated through heat integration and alternative uses of the coproduct biochar, which can be sold as an energy source to displace coal, soil amendment or processed into activated carbon. The impacts of optimization on the cost of hydrocarbon biofuel production as well as the environmental impacts were investigated through a technoeconomic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA), respectively, with two-step and one-step processing compared to fossil fuels. The TEA indicates that a one-step heat integrated pathway with the production of activated carbon has a minimum selling price of $3.23/gallon compared to $5.16/gallon for a two-step heat integrated process with burning of the coproduct biochar to displace coal. The LCA indicates that using the displacement analysis approach, a two-step heat integrated pathway had a global warming potential of -102 g CO2 equivalent/MJ biofuel compared to 16 CO2 equivalent/MJ biofuel for the heat integrated one-step pathway.\",\"[Kulas, Daniel; Winjobi, Olumide; Shonnard, David] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Chem Engn, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Winjobi, Olumide; Zhou, Wen; Shonnard, David] Michigan Technol Univ, Sustainable Futures Inst, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Zhou, Wen] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA\",\"Kulas, D; Shonnard, D (reprint author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Chem Engn, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Zhou, W; Shonnard, D (reprint author), Michigan Technol Univ, Sustainable Futures Inst, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Zhou, W (reprint author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.\",dgkulas@mtu.edu; wzhou1@mtu.edu; drshonna@mtu.edu,,,\"National Science Foundation [MPS/CHE-ENG/ECCS-1230803, OISE-1243444]; Richard and Bonnie Robbins Endowment\",\"Financial support from the National Science Foundation MPS/CHE-ENG/ECCS-1230803 Sustainable Energy Pathways (SEP) grant, the OISE-1243444 Partnerships for International Research and Education (FIRE) grant, and the Richard and Bonnie Robbins Endowment is gratefully acknowledged.\",,48.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,\"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA\",2168-0485,,,ACS SUSTAIN CHEM ENG,ACS Sustain.

Despite this promise, social-ecological interactions are complex and elusive; they require simplification to guide effective application of the SES approach. The complex, adaptive and place-specific nature of human-environment interactions impedes determination of state and trends in SES parameters of interest to managers and policy makers. Based on a rigorously developed systemic theoretical model, this paper integrates field observations, interviews, surveys, and latent variable modeling to illustrate the development of simplified and easily interpretable indicators of the state of, and trends in, relevant SES processes. Social-agricultural interactions in the Logone floodplain, in the Lake Chad basin, served as case study. This approach is found to generate simplified determinants of the state of SESs, easily communicable across the array of stakeholders common in human-environment interactions. The approach proves to be useful for monitoring SESs, guiding interventions, and assessing the effectiveness of interventions. It incorporates real time responses to biophysical change in understanding coarse scale processes within which finer scales are embedded. This paper emphasizes the importance of merging quantitative and qualitative methods for effective monitoring and assessment of SESs.\",\"Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA\",\"Asah, ST (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.\",asah0002@umn.edu,,,University of Minnesota,\"I wish to recognize the Cameroon Association for Environmental Education, specifically Mr. Aboukar Mohamat, for assistance with field research and logistical support.

This methodology accounts for parameter and prediction uncertainties associated with such models and facilitates objective selection of the simplest model, out of available alternatives, which does not significantly compromise the ability to accurately model observations. We use this methodology to compare various Jarvis canopy conductance model configurations, embedded within a larger transpiration model, against canopy transpiration measured by sap flux. The results indicate that descriptions of the dependence of stomatal conductance on vapor pressure deficit, photosynthetic radiation, and temperature, as well as the gradual variation in canopy conductance through the season are essential in the transpiration model. Use of soil moisture was moderately significant, but only when used with a hyperbolic vapor pressure deficit relationship. Subtle differences in model quality could be clearly associated with small structural changes through the use of this methodology. The results also indicate that increments in model complexity are not always accompanied by improvements in model quality and that such improvements are conditional on model structure. Possible application of this methodology to compare complex semiempirical models of natural systems in general is also discussed.\",\"[Samanta, S.] Woods Hole Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA; [Clayton, M.

To quantify the contribution of U.S. neighborhood parks to the time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) by the local population. Methods. Observational data on the use of 10 parks in five US cities collected during summer and fall 2008 were analyzed by a model-averaging approach. Estimated MVPA time accrued in parks was compared to estimated total MVPA time accrued by the local population, based upon national estimates. Results. On average, parks provided roughly 4000 hours of use and 1500 MVPA hours per week. Park use accounted for approximately 50% of the vigorous physical activity (VPA) time of those living within 0.5 miles of the park and 16% of those living within 1.0 miles of the park. Parks accounted for a modest proportion of moderate physical activity (MPA) time, about 14% and 4% for those living within 0.5 miles and 1.0 miles of the park, respectively. Conclusion. Parks have significant roles in supporting vigorous physical activity of the local population. Because they are underutilized and vigorous activity is critical to child development and adult physical fitness, efforts should be made to promote vigorous activity within local parks.

It was an attempt to incorporate ecosystem service evaluation model within a general modeling framework in typical semi-arid region. The ecosystem service value was modified according to the development of eco-environment and social economy in Took Mu Qinqi based on the study of land ecosystem service value in China. The modified ecosystem service value provided input parameters for the optimization model. The results showed that the ecosystem service value of grassland was the highest among the six land-use categories, with about 97% and 83% of the total value for East and West Took Mu Qinqi, respectively. It indicated that grassland played an important role in ecosystem service. The results also showed that the total economic benefit produced by the optimal land use pattern increased by [11.5, 12.6], [5.66, 6.36] x 10(12) RMB (sic) compared with the current land-use pattern for East, West Took Mu Qinqi, respectively. The total ecosystem service value produced by the optimal land-use pattern also increased by [5.9, 9.1], [3.4, 4.5] x 10(12) RMB (sic) compared with that produced by the current land-use pattern for East, West Took Mu Qinqi, respectively. It indicated that the optimal land use pattern generated by the multi-objective model was better than the current land-use pattern either from the point of economic benefit or from the point of ecological benefit. The optimization model of land-use structure based on ecosystem service value could satisfy the social, economical, and environmental development, which provided a new way to solve the key technical problem in land-use planning in typical semi-arid region.

Present study was aimed to investigate the concentration of fugitive PAHs in the environment (outdoor and indoor settings), associated probabilistic health risk assessment in the exposed population, and possible linkage between fuel consumption patterns and PAHs emissions in twin cities (Rawalpindi and Islamabad) of Pakistan. Results showed that the mean PAHs concentrations (air: 2390 pg m(-3); dust: 167 ng g(-1)) in the indoor environment were higher than that of the outdoor environment (air: 2132 pg m(-3); dust: 90.0 ng g(-1)). Further, the source apportionment PCA-MLR receptor model identified diesel and gasoline combustion as the primary PAHs sources in the urban and sub-urban settings. Estimated life cancer risk (LCR) potential via inhalation to indoor PAHs was higher with a probability of 2.0 cases per 10,000 inhabitants as compared to outdoor exposure. Incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) model from exposure to dust bound PAHs showed risk in the order of ingestion > dermal > inhalation for various exposure pathways. Likewise, estimated daily intake (EDI) model reflects that PAHs in surface dust enter into the human body mainly through the respiratory system because EDI for breathing was reported higher than that of oral intake. Therefore, adoption of sustainable fuels is recommended to meet the energy requirements and to reduce PAHs emissions and related health risks in the twin cities of Pakistan. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Their emissions can vary substantially with climate, soil, and crop management. While different methods are available to account for GHG emissions in life cycle assessments (LCA) of crop production, there are no standard procedures. In this study, the objectives were: (i) to compare several methods of estimating CO2 and N2O emissions for a LCA of cropping systems and (ii) to estimate the relative contribution of soil GHG emissions to the overall global warming potential (GWP) using results from a field experiment located in Manitoba, Canada. The methods were: (A) measurements; (B) Tier I and (C) Tier II IPCC (Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change) methodology, (D) a simple carbon model combined with Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) Tier II methodology for soil N2O emissions, and (E) the DNDC (DeNitrification DeComposition) agroecosystem model. The estimated GWPs (-7.2-17 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) y(-1); -80 to 600 kg CO(2)eq GJ(-1) y(-1)) were similar to previous results in North America and no statistical difference was found between GWP based on methods D and E and GWP based on observations. The five methods gave estimates of soil CO2 emissions that were not statistically different from each other, whereas for N2O emissions only DNDC estimates were similar to observations. Across crop types, all methods gave comparable CO2 and N2O emission estimates for perennial and legume crops, but only DNDC gave similar results with respect to observations for both annual and cereal crops. Whilst the results should be confirmed for other locations, the agroecosystem model and method D can be used, at certainly one selected site, in place of observations for estimating GHGs in agricultural LCA.

BackgroundIn 2011, an ongoing project on a new model of family medicine practice was launched in Slovenia; the family physicians' working team (a family physician and a practice nurse) was extended by a nurse practitioner working 0.5 full-time equivalents. This was an example of a personalised team approach to managing chronic patients. MethodsWe included all family medicine practices in the six units of the Community Health Centre Ljubljana which were participating in the project in December 2015 (N=66). Data were gathered from automatic electronic reports on quality indicators provided monthly by each practice. We also collected demographic data. ResultsThere were 66 family medicine teams in the sample, with 165 members of their teams (66 family physicians, 33 nurse practitioners and 66 practice nurses). Fifty-six (84.4%) of the family physicians were women, as were 32 (97.0%) of the nurse practitioners, and 86 (95.5%) of the practice nurses. Multivariate analysis showed that a higher level of the quality indicator Examination of diabetic foot once per year was independently associated with nurse practitioners having attended additional education on diabetes, duration of participation in the project, age and years worked since graduation of nurse practitioners, working in the Center unit and not working in the Bezigrad unit. ConclusionsCharacteristics of team members are important in fostering quality management of chronic patients. Nurse practitioners working in new model family practices need obligatory, continuous professional education in the management of chronic patients. Relevance to clinical practiceThe quality of care of chronic patients depends on the specific characteristics of the members of the team, which should be taken into account when planning quality improvements.\",\"[Klemenc-Ketis, Zalika; Poplas-Susic, Antonija] Community Hlth Ctr Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Klemenc-Ketis, Zalika] Univ Ljubljana, Dept Family Med, Fac Med, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Klemenc-Ketis, Zalika] Univ Maribor, Dept Family Med, Fac Med, Maribor, Slovenia\",\"Klemenc-Ketis, Z (reprint author), Community Hlth Ctr Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.\",zalika.klemenc@um.si,,,,,,42.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,\"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA\",0962-1067,1365-2702,,J CLIN NURS,J.

In this study, growth rates of 3 species of filter-feeders were examined over a geographic region that includes sites where upwelling is typically weak (south of Point Conception, California, USA) and sites where upwelling is often strong and frequent (at and to the north of Point Conception). The growth of the mussel Mytilus californianus, the gooseneck barnacle Pollicipes polymerus and the acorn barnacle Balanus glandula, as well as the body condition of M californianus, were all up to 3-6 times higher at sites furthest south of Point Conception, and decreased dramatically moving north around the point. Spatial variation in food availability (measured as chlorophyll a, particulate organic carbon and particulate organic nitrogen) and food quality (measured as C/N ratios) did not explain these patterns of growth. Tidal height of the organisms also failed to account for persistent spatial variation in growth rates. Water temperature varied in a pattern consistent with growth rates (i.e. mean temperatures were warmer in the south), and was the one factor most often selected in step-wise regressions for models contributing to patterns of filter-feeder growth. This study suggests that factors other than, or in conjunction with, productivity may drive large-scale differences in benthic filter-feeder growth rates.\",\"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol & Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA\",\"Phillips, NE (reprint author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.\",nicole.phillips@vuw.ac.nz,\"Phillips, Nicole/M-6342-2016\",\"Phillips, Nicole/0000-0002-9234-8164\",,,\"ABBOTT MR, 1985, CONT SHELF RES, V4, P661, DOI 10.1016/0278-4343(85)90035-4; ATKINSON LP, 1986, J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS, V91, P2899, DOI 10.1029/JC091iC11p12899; BARLOW RG, 1982, J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL, V63, P239, DOI 10.1016/0022-0981(82)90181-2; BARNES H, 1959, J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK, V38, P581, DOI 10.1017/S0025315400007001; BARNES H, 1953, J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK, V32, P107, DOI 10.1017/S0025315400011450; BARNES H., 1959, OIKOS, V10, P1, DOI 10.2307/3564902; BAYNE BL, 1976, OECOLOGIA, V22, P211, DOI 10.1007/BF00344793; BERTNESS MD, 1991, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V75, P91, DOI 10.3354/meps075091; Blanchette CA, 2002, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V239, P69, DOI 10.3354/meps239069; BRINK KH, 1984, J PHYS OCEANOGR, V14, P378, DOI 10.1175/1520-0485(1984)014<0378:OOTCUR>2.0.CO;2; Broitman BR, 2001, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V224, P21, DOI 10.3354/meps224021; BROWN PC, 1986, J PLANKTON RES, V8, P55, DOI 10.1093/plankt/8.1.55; BUSS LW, 1986, COMMUNITY ECOLOGY, P517; BUSTAMANTE RH, 1995, OECOLOGIA, V102, P189, DOI 10.1007/BF00333251; CLIFF G, 1982, T ROY SOC S AFR, V44, P523, DOI 10.1080/00359198209519140; CLIFF G, 1982, T ROY SOC S AFR, V44, P539, DOI 10.1080/00359198209519141; COE WR, 1944, J EXP ZOOL, V94, P59; Connell J.H., 1972, Annual Rev Ecol Syst, V3, P169, DOI 10.1146/annurev.es.03.110172.001125; CRISP DJ, 1960, J ANIM ECOL, V29, P95, DOI 10.2307/2273; CRISP DJ, 1985, ADV MAR BIOL, V22, P199, DOI 10.1016/S0065-2881(08)60052-8; DEMERS S, 1989, MAR BIOL, V100, P393, DOI 10.1007/BF00391155; DUGDALE RC, 1989, DEEP-SEA RES, V36, P985, DOI 10.1016/0198-0149(89)90074-5; FIELD JG, 1980, ESTUAR COAST MAR SCI, V11, P133, DOI 10.1016/S0302-3524(80)80037-5; HICKEY BM, 1993, ECOLOGY SO CALIFORNI, P19; Lalli C.

The IWRM approach has found particular use in the new water policies of Southern African countries such as Zimbabwe, where water scarcity, after the land question, is perceived to be a major threat to political, economic, social, military and environmental security. Ultimately, IWRM is seen as providing a framework towards ensuring broader security at the local, national, regional and global levels. However, the pilot phase implementation of the new water policy in the various regional countries has revealed that although the legal and institutional frameworks have been put in place, the implementation of the IWRM approach has tended to be problematic (J. Latham, 2001; GTZ, 2000; Leestemaker, 2000; Savenige and van der Zaag, 2000; Sithole, 2000). This paper adopts a case study approach and empirically examines the institutional challenges of implementing the IWRM approach in the post-pilot phase of Zimbabwe's new water policy. The focus is mainly on the institutional arrangements surrounding the Pungwe-Mutare Water Supply Project located within the Save Catchment Area in Eastern Zimbabwe. The major findings of the study are that, while there persist some problems associated with the traditional management approach, there have also emerged new challenges to IWRM. These mainly relate to the transaction costs of the water sector reforms, institutional resilience, stakeholder participation, and the achievement of the desired outcomes. There have also been problems emanating from unexpected political developments at the local and national levels, particularly with regard to the government's \"\"fast track\"\" land resettlement programme. The paper concludes that there is a need for a more rigorous effort towards integrating the management of water resources by the catchment level institutions.

The goals of this study were to compare the delivery of preventive services by practices in four primary care funding models and to identify organizational factors associated with superior preventive care. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we included 137 primary care practices in the province of Ontario (35 fee-for-service practices, 35 with salaried physicians [community health centres], 35 practices in the new capitation model [family health networks] and 32 practices in the established capitation model [health services organizations]). We surveyed 288 family physicians. We re viewed 4108 randomly selected patient charts and assigned prevention scores based on the proportion of eligible preventive manoeuvres delivered for each patient. Results: A total of 3284 patients were eligible for at least one of six preventive manoeuvres. After adjusting for patient profile and contextual factors, we found that, compared with prevention scores in practices in the new capitation model, scores were significantly lower in fee-for-service practices (beta estimate for effect on prevention score = -6.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] -11.9 to -0.6) and practices in the established capitation model (beta = -9.1, 95% CI -14.9 to -3.3) but not for those with salaried remuneration (beta = -0.8, 95% CI -6.5 to 4.8). After accounting for physician characteristics and organizational structure, the type of funding model was no longer a statistically significant factor. Compared with reference practices, those with at least one female family physician (beta = 8.0, 95% CI 4.2 to 11.8), a panel size of fewer than 1600 patients per full-time equivalent family physician (beta = 6.8, 95% CI 3.1 to 10.6) and an electronic reminder system (beta = 4.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 8.7) had superior prevention scores. The effect of these three factors was largely but not always consistent across the funding models; it was largely consistent across the preventive manoeuvres. Interpretation: No funding model was clearly associated with superior preventive care. Factors related to physician characteristics and practice structure were stronger predictors of performance. Practices with one or more female physicians, a smaller patient load and an electronic reminder system had superior prevention scores. Our findings raise questions about re form initiatives aimed at increasing patient numbers, but they support the adoption of information technology.\",\"[Dahrouge, Simone; Hogg, William E.; Russell, Grant; Tuna, Meltem; Muldoon, Laura K.; Fletcher, John] Univ Ottawa, CT Lamont Primary Hlth Care Res Ctr, Dept Family Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Russell, Grant] Monash Univ, So Acad Primary Care Res Unit, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Geneau, Robert] Int Dev Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Kristjansson, Elizabeth] Univ Ottawa, Sch Psychol, Inst Populat Hlth, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada\",\"Dahrouge, S (reprint author), Univ Ottawa, CT Lamont Primary Hlth Care Res Ctr, Dept Family Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada.\",sdahrouge@bruyere.org,,,Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care,Funding of the original study on which this research is based was provided by the Primary Health Care Transition Fund of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.

Therefore, evaluating the comprehensive benefit of eco-industrial parks and providing references and policy formulation in supporting the improvement of construction and management level for eco-industrial parks are of great significance. In this paper, a hybrid framework was proposed to assess the comprehensive benefit of eco-industrial parks in terms of circular economy and sustainability. Firstly, the evaluation index system was constructed by using grey-Delphi method, which included economic benefit criteria, social benefit criteria, and environmental benefit criteria with nine quantitative sub-criteria and four qualitative sub-criteria. Then, a new comparison-based method, namely the best-worst method, was employed to determine the weights of all sub-criteria and the performance values of all selected eco-industrial parks with respect to the qualitative sub-criteria. Finally, five selected representative eco-industrial parks in China were ranked in terms of comprehensive benefit, and the optimal eco-industrial park was selected. According to the results of comprehensive benefit evaluation for eco-industrial parks, the strengths and weaknesses of each eco-industrial park were obvious. At the end, the recommendations for the effective and rapid development of eco-industrial parks were formulated.\",\"[Zhao, Haoran; Guo, Sen; Zhao, Huiru] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 2 Beinong Rd, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China\",\"Guo, S (reprint author), North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 2 Beinong Rd, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.\",haoranzhao0118@163.com; guosen@ncepu.edu.cn; zhaohuiru@ncepu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373076],This paper was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71373076).,,50.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,15.0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,\"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS\",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Lightweighting is an important strategy to reduce use phase fuel consumption and potentially reduce vehicle life cycle impacts. A popular lightweighting technique is material substitution, in which conventional materials (e.g., iron, steel) are replaced with lighter ones (e.g., aluminum, magnesium). Material substitution, however, often results in higher material production impacts. A life cycle approach is useful in evaluating these material tradeoffs and assessing the overall energy and emissions benefits of lightweighting technologies. Thin-wall ductile cast iron (TWDCI) is a lightweighting fabrication technology that can provide comparable weight reduction to aluminum while having better mechanical properties. This study develops a parametric life cycle model to assess the life cycle performance of TWDCI compared to conventional cast iron and cast aluminum in terms of energy (MJ) and GHGs (as carbon dioxide equivalents - kg CO(2)e). This model was applied to three lightweighting cases: a differential casing, an engine block, and replacement of all cast iron parts. Fuel reduction values (FRVs) are used to calculate change in fuel consumption due to lightweighting. A sensitivity analysis on these lightweighting cases is employed to determine the mass reduction required to achieve net life cycle benefits and to show the effect of alloy composition on life cycle energy and emissions. Lightweighting by 2% results in equal life cycle energy and GHGs for TWDCI and conventional cast iron while 37% lightweighting is required for TWDCI to equal cast aluminum impacts. The implications of powertrain resizing afforded by lightweighting are also explored.\",\"[Jhaveri, Krutarth; Lewis, Geoffrey M.; Sullivan, John L.; Keoleian, Gregory A.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ctr Sustainable Syst, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Jhaveri, Krutarth] Univ Michigan, Chem Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Keoleian, Gregory A.] Univ Michigan, Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA\",\"Keoleian, GA (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ctr Sustainable Syst, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.\",gregak@umich.edu,,,\"U.S. Navy's Office of Naval Research; American Lightweight Materials Manufacturing Innovation Institute (ALMMII); Office of Naval Research (ONR) [F043665, 0003 LCA]\",\"This research was conducted through Lightweight Innovations for Tomorrow (LIFT), a collaboration between universities and private industries to promote the development of lightweight materials manufacturing technologies, which is funded by the U.S. Navy's Office of Naval Research.

Over 100 years of agricultural development the Murrumbidgee Basin experienced a \"\"pendulum swing\"\" in terms of water allocation, initially exclusively for agriculture production changing over to reallocation back to the environment. In this paper, we hypothesize that in the competition for water between economic livelihood and environmental wellbeing, economic diversification was the key to swinging community sentiment in favor of environmental protection, and triggering policy action that resulted in more water allocation to the environment. To test this hypothesis, we developed a socio-hydrology model to link the dynamics of the whole economy (both agriculture and industry composed of manufacturing and services) to the community's sensitivity toward the environment. Changing community sensitivity influenced how water was allocated and governed and how the agricultural sector grew relative to the industrial sector (composed of manufacturing and services sectors). In this way, we show that economic diversification played a key role in influencing the community's values and preferences with respect to the environment and economic growth. Without diversification, model simulations show that the community would not have been sufficiently sensitive and willing enough to act to restore the environment, highlighting the key role of sectoral transformation in achieving the goal of sustainable agricultural development.\",\"[Roobavannan, M.; Kandasamy, J.; Vigneswaran, S.] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Panda, S.] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Water Management, Delft, Netherlands; [Sivapalan, M.] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL USA; [Sivapalan, M.] Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Urbana, IL USA\",\"Kandasamy, J (reprint author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\",jaya.kandasamy@uts.edu.au,,\"Sivapalan, Murugesu/0000-0003-3004-3530\",US National Science Foundation's Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC; NSF) [DBI-1052875]; Australian Postgraduate Award,\"This paper falls within the framework of the Panta-Rhei Research Initiative of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS).

Methods: We examined the relative contribution of eight different pathways between education and diabetes incidence over a 9-year period in Ontario, Canada. Our data source was respondents (35-60 years of age) to the 2000-2001 Canadian Community Health Survey individually linked with physician and hospital administrative data. Our sample contained 11,899 participants with no previous diagnosis of diabetes. The direct and indirect effects of education level on incident diabetes were estimated using Aalen additive hazard models. Results: Not having completed secondary education was associated with 120 extra diabetes cases per 10,000 men per year and 43 additional diabetes cases per 10,000 women per year, compared with having Bachelors education or higher. Body mass index accounted for 13 of the 120 extra diabetes cases among men, and 24 of the 43 additional diabetes cases for women. Conclusions: Of the mediating pathways examined in this paper, body mass index was the pathway through which the largest number of diabetes cases was mediated among men and women.

The combined application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) - the input-oriented BCC (Banker/Charnes/Cooper) model - has been chosen as a tool for the comprehensive eco-efficiency assessment, due to its high capability to measure regional eco-efficiency. The ultimate goal of this approach is to support the strategic decision-making process. The research brings numerous findings. Firstly, it exposes that four (Mazowieckie, Podlaskie, Warminsko-Mazurskie and Wielkopolskie) of the sixteen Polish regions are being relatively eco-efficient. Certainly, the fact that agriculture and services contribute the most to the creation of GDP in these regions has an influence on the achieved results. Secondly, the study proves that Slaskie region, having the most detrimental impact on the environment in all areas of protection, i.e. human health 0.127 DALY.ha(-1), ecosystems 0.000557 SPECIES.YR.ha(-1) and resources 3009 $.ha(-1), is the most eco-inefficient. The causes of the observed eco-inefficiency of Polish regions are also explored, with the conclusion that the fundamental ones are cumulative airborne emissions (primarily carbon dioxide) and the excessive consumption of fuels, energy and heat in relation to the produced value of goods and services. Finally, heavy industry remains a basic source of environmental pressure and thus the decision makers ought to pay greater attention to the implementation of the best available techniques.

Here, we present a novel framework for identifying emergent social behaviours in foragers (including humans engaged in fishing or hunting) in predator-prey contexts based on the exploration difficulty and exploitation potential of a renewable natural resource. A qualitative framework is introduced that predicts when foragers should behave territorially, search collectively, act independently or switch among these states. To validate it, we derived quantitative predictions from two models of different structure: a generic mathematical model, and a lattice-based evolutionary model emphasising exploitation and exclusion costs. These models independently identified that the exploration difficulty and exploitation potential of the natural resource controls the social behaviour of resource exploiters. Our theoretical predictions were finally compared to a diverse set of empirical cases focusing on fisheries and aquatic organisms across a range of taxa, substantiating the framework's predictions. Understanding social behaviour for given social-ecological characteristics has important implications, particularly for the design of governance structures and regulations to move exploited systems, such as fisheries, towards sustainability. Our framework provides concrete steps in this direction.\",\"[Monk, Christopher T.; Romanczuk, Pawel; Arlinghaus, Robert] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Barbier, Matthieu] CNRS, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Paris, France; [Romanczuk, Pawel] Humboldt Univ, Inst Theoret Biol, Dept Biol, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Romanczuk, Pawel; Rubenstein, Daniel I.; Levin, Simon A.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Watson, James R.] Swedish Royal Acad Sci, Global Econ Dynam & Biosphere Programme, Stockholm, Sweden; [Watson, James R.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Alos, Josep] IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, Esporles, Illes Balears, Spain; [Nakayama, Shinnosuke] NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, New York, NY USA; [Arlinghaus, Robert] Humboldt Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Crop & Anim Sci, Div Integrat Fisheries Management, Invalidenstr 42, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Arlinghaus, Robert] Humboldt Univ, IRI THESys, Invalidenstr 42, D-10115 Berlin, Germany\",\"Monk, CT (reprint author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany.\",monk@igb-berlin.de,,,\"Princeton University; Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin on \"\"Princeton-Humboldt Centre for the Reality Mining of Animal Systems\"\"; 'Cooperation and Collective Cognition Network'; project 'B-Types' [SAW-2013-IGB-2]; NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural-Human Systems [GEO-1211972]; Nordforsk; National Science Foundation [OCE-1426746]; JdC post-doc grant - Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [IJCI-2016-27681]; German Research Foundation [DFG RO4766/2-1]; DARPA YFA award [N66001-17-1-4038]\",\"The work on this paper was supported by a Strategic Grant by Princeton University and Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin on \"\"Princeton-Humboldt Centre for the Reality Mining of Animal Systems,\"\" the 'Cooperation and Collective Cognition Network' and by the project 'B-Types' (SAW-2013-IGB-2).

Excess fluoride concentrations in drinking water supplies negatively impact the health of communities living in fluoride affected regions of the world by causing dental and skeletal fluorosis and other severe socio-economic problems. Given that fluoride mitigation solutions have proven elusive, we apply business model logic to compare fluoride removal technologies to examine the financial sustainability of water service provisions. We analyze the investment cost of producing fluoride safe water, the annual revenues generated, and the net benefits obtained from different technologies. Furthermore, the reduced medical costs and productivity losses averted due to access to fluoride safe water can lead to an average annual cost saving of $67 per person. Our results validate the use of business models to help evaluate different technologies as a means of pursuing sustainable applications for safe drinking water.\",\"[Yami, Teshome L.; Sabatini, David A.; Busenitz, Lowell W.] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Civil Engn & Environm Sci & Entrepreneurship, 202 W Boyd St,Room 334, Norman, OK 73019 USA\",\"Yami, TL (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Sch Civil Engn & Environm Sci & Entrepreneurship, 202 W Boyd St,Room 334, Norman, OK 73019 USA.\",teshome.l.yami-1@ou.edu,,,University of Oklahoma Water Technologies for Emerging Regions (WaTER) Center; Sun Oil Company Endowed Chair; Ken Hoving Graduate College Fellowship,\"This work was funded in part by The University of Oklahoma Water Technologies for Emerging Regions (WaTER) Center, the Sun Oil Company Endowed Chair, and the Ken Hoving Graduate College Fellowship.\",,29.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,\"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND\",2043-9083,,,J WATER SANIT HYG DE,J.

A simple isotope mass-balance model was used to calculate atmospheric O-2 levels from the burial rates of organic C and pyrite S. Burial rates were derived from the C- and S-isotope records of seawater-dissolved inorganic C and sulfate. Results indicate that in the early Cenozoic atmospheric O-2 levels were about 16% higher than current levels. Extension of the model to Phanerozoic time scales yields atmospheric O-2 levels that are inconsistent with geological evidence that suggests that the mass of atmospheric O-2 has not changed by more than a factor of two from the present atmospheric level since the Cambrian (Berkner and Marshall, 1974; Watson et al., 1978; Jones and Chaloner, 1991). These results indicate that either our knowledge of the parameters controlling atmospheric O-2 is incomplete, or that the assumptions used in such models inadequately represent the complexity of the natural systems. Here we critically examine the assumptions inherent in isotope mass-balance models to determine whether they may be the source of the model-data discord. A major problem with these models is the extreme sensitivity of the mass of atmospheric O-2 to very small changes in the much larger masses of oxidized and reduced C and S reservoirs. For example, small variations in continental weathering fluxes and the associated isotope ratios of river input have profound effects on calculated O-2 levels and need to be accounted for. Similarly, variations in the isotopic composition of pyrite and organic C buried in sediments, which are strongly influenced by changes in isotopic fractionation, dramatically influence calculated O-2 concentrations. Thus, constant fractionation factors should not be applied in such models. In addition, the assumption that the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic C is controlled only by the relative amounts of reduced and oxidized C buried in sediments and their respective isotope ratios is questionable when relatively short time scales are considered. Isotope mass-balance models do not adequately encompass and simulate the actual processes being modeled because of the simplifications and assumptions made. More \"\"realistic\"\" models are required to achieve stabilization of atmospheric O-2 over geological time.\",\"Stanford Univ, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Geophys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA\",\"Paytan, A (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.\",,,,,,,59.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,V H WINSTON & SON INC,PALM BEACH,\"360 SOUTH OCEAN BLVD, PH-B, PALM BEACH, FL 33480 USA\",0020-6814,,,INT GEOL REV,Int.

Land use and land cover are incorporated as elements of the human and environment system respectively. Drivers and associated processes that influence land use, land cover, and land system dynamics are incorporated within a set of sub-systems. The model includes consideration of driving sub-systems as a set of capital funds and flows, and how these are influenced by linkages between processes in the human (socio-economic) and environment systems and sub-systems. The model is consistent with existing models of the biophysical earth system used by the land change, earth system sciences, and socio-ecological systems communities. The purposes of the model are to provide (i) a holistic framework within which descriptions, models and analyses that focus on various components of land can be placed to describe and explain land systems and land system changes; and (ii) a guide for the development of more fully integrated and interdisciplinary understanding, analysis and study of land use and land cover dynamics, with explicit focus on relationships between human and natural systems.\",\"[Aspinall, Richard] Univ Reg Amazon IKIAM, Km 7 Via Muyuna Atacapi, Tena 150102, Ecuador; [Aspinall, Richard] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Staiano, Michele] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Ind Engn, 80 Ple Tecchio, I-80125 Naples, Italy\",\"Aspinall, R (reprint author), Univ Reg Amazon IKIAM, Km 7 Via Muyuna Atacapi, Tena 150102, Ecuador.; Aspinall, R (reprint author), James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.\",rjaspinall10@gmail.com; mstaiano@unina.it,,,University of Naples; STAD group based at University of Naples Federico II,Richard Aspinall acknowledges financial support from University of Naples for collaboration with the STAD group based at University of Naples Federico II.

Results showed that soil N had significant seasonal fluctuations and vertical distribution, and the net N mineralization rates in topsoil were significantly different in growing season (p < 0.01). The N/P ratio (9.87 +/- 1.23) of S. salsa was less than 14, indicating that plant growth was limited by N. The N accumulated in S. salsa litter at all times during decomposition, which was ascribed to the N immobilization by microbes from the environment. Soil organic N was the main N stock of plant-soil system, accounting for 97.35% of the total N stock. The N absorption and utilization coefficients of S. salsa were very low (0.0145 and 0.3844, respectively), while the N cycle coefficient was high (0.7108). The results of the N turnovers among compartments of S. salsa wetland showed that the N uptake amount of aboveground part and root were 7.764 g/m(2)and 4.332 g/m(2), respectively. The N translocation amounts from aboveground part to root and from root to soil were 3.881 g/m(2) and 0.626 g/m(2), respectively. The N translocation amount from aboveground living body to litter was 3.883 g/m(2), the annual N return amount from litter to soil was more than 0.125(-) g/m(2) (minus represented immobilization), and the net N mineralization amount in topsoil (0-15 cm) in growing season was 1.190 g/m(2). The assessment of N biological cycle status of S. salsa wetland indicated that N was a very important limiting factor and the ecosystem was situated in unstable and vulnerable status. The S. salsa was seemingly well adapted to the low-nutrient status and vulnerable habitat, and the N quantitative relationships determined in the compartment model might provide scientific base for us to reveal the special adaptive strategy of S. salsa to the vulnerable habitat in the following studies.\",\"[Sun Zhigao; Sun Jingkuan; Yu Xiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shandong Key Lab Ecoenvironm Sci Yellow River Del, Coastal Wetland Ecol Res Base, Yantai Inst Coastal Zone Res, Binzhou 256603, Peoples R China; [Sun Zhigao; Mou Xiaojie; Song Hongli; Wang Lingling; Jiang Huanhuan; Sun Wanlong; Sun Wenguang] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Coastal Environm Proc, Shandong Prov Key Lab Coastal Zone Environm Proc, Yantai Inst Coastal Zone Res, Yantai 264003, Peoples R China; [Mou Xiaojie] Chinese Acad Sci, NE Inst Geog & Agroecol, Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Environm, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China; [Mou Xiaojie; Song Hongli; Wang Lingling; Jiang Huanhuan; Sun Wanlong; Sun Wenguang] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China\",\"Sun, ZG (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shandong Key Lab Ecoenvironm Sci Yellow River Del, Coastal Wetland Ecol Res Base, Yantai Inst Coastal Zone Res, Binzhou 256603, Peoples R China.\",zgsun@yic.ac.cn,,,\"Shandong Key Laboratory for Yellow River Delta Eco-Environmental Science, Binzhou, China [2007KFJJ01]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-YW-223]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [40803023, 41171424]; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2010DZ001]\",\"Under the auspices of Open Research Fund Program of Shandong Key Laboratory for Yellow River Delta Eco-Environmental Science, Binzhou, China (No. 2007KFJJ01), Knowledge Innovation Programs of Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. KZCX2-YW-223), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 40803023, 41171424), Key Program of Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (No. ZR2010DZ001)\",\"Ahmad S, 2009, SOIL TILL RES, V106, P54, DOI 10.1016/j.still.2009.09.005; [王庆改 Bai Junhong], 2010, [湿地科学, Wetland Science], V8, P164; Boyer KE, 2005, J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL, V321, P59, DOI 10.1016/j.jembe.2005.01.005; BRINKLEY D, 1991, FOREST ECOL MANAG, V40, P13; CHEN L-Z, 1983, Acta Botanica Sinica, V25, P67; Cui BS, 2009, ECOL ENG, V35, P1090, DOI 10.1016/j.ecoleng.2009.03.022; Eriksson PG, 2003, ESTUAR COAST SHELF S, V58, P861, DOI 10.1016/j.ecss.2003.07.002; Fair JM, 2006, ENVIRON POLLUT, V140, P500, DOI 10.1016/j.envpol.2005.08.005; Gessner MO, 2000, AQUAT BOT, V66, P9, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3770(99)00022-4; Gu FT, 1999, J BINZHOU ED COLL, V5, P43; Han N, 2005, J PLANT PHYSIOL, V162, P267, DOI 10.1016/j.jplph.2004.07.016; HE CQ, 2001, ACTA ECOLOGICA SINIC, V21, P2074; Kochy M, 1997, ECOLOGY, V78, P732, DOI 10.2307/2266053; Koerselman W, 1996, J APPL ECOL, V33, P1441, DOI 10.2307/2404783; Li JianBing, 2008, Research of Environmental Sciences, V21, P98; LI YS, 1992, AM MIDL NAT, V128, P61, DOI 10.2307/2426413; [李玉中 Li Yuzhong], 2003, [植物生态学报, Acta Phytoecologica Sinica], V27, P177; Lin P, 2001, J XIAMEN U NATURAL S, V40, P592; Liu Chang-e, 2008, Shengtaixue Zazhi, V27, P418; Liu J.S., 2000, CHINESE J APPL ECOLO, V11, P898; Liu JS, 2008, J ENVIRON SCI-CHINA, V20, P470, DOI 10.1016/S1001-0742(08)62081-1; Liu JS, 2005, J ENVIRON SCI-CHINA, V17, P521; Liu ZhiPeng, 2010, Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering, V26, P71; LUXMOORE RJ, 1971, PLANT SOIL, V34, P561, DOI 10.1007/BF01372813; MASHHADY AS, 1982, PLANT SOIL, V68, P207, DOI 10.1007/BF02373706; Mistch W J, 2000, WETLANDS, P89; MOONEY HA, 1987, SCIENCE, V238, P926, DOI 10.1126/science.238.4829.926; Mou X.J., 2010, STUDY NITROGEN BIOL; NADELHOFFER KJ, 1985, ECOLOGY, V66, P1377, DOI 10.2307/1939190; Naidoo G, 2009, AQUAT BOT, V90, P184, DOI 10.1016/j.aquabot.2008.10.001; OLSON JS, 1963, ECOLOGY, V44, P322, DOI 10.2307/1932179; PARAMITA N, 2007, WETL ECOL MANAG, V15, P347, DOI DOI 10.1007/S11273-007-9036-8; Perez CA, 1998, ECOSYSTEMS, V1, P361; RAISON RJ, 1987, SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM, V19, P521, DOI 10.1016/0038-0717(87)90094-0; REUSS JO, 1977, ECOLOGY, V58, P379, DOI 10.2307/1935612; Ruckauf U, 2004, SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM, V36, P77, DOI 10.1016/j.soilbio.2003.08.021; Sierra J, 1997, SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM, V29, P1557, DOI 10.1016/S0038-0717(96)00288-X; SU B, 2001, ACTA PHYTOECOLOGICA, V25, P195; Sun ZG, 2007, J ENVIRON SCI-CHINA, V19, P986, DOI 10.1016/S1001-0742(07)60161-2; Sun Zhi-gao, 2009, Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao, V20, P277; Sun Zhi-gao, 2007, Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao, V18, P1771; [孙志高 SUN Zhigao], 2007, [水土保持学报, Journal of Soil and Water Conservation], V21, P25; Sun Zhigao, 2007, STUDY NITROGEN BIOGE; Tessier JT, 2003, J APPL ECOL, V40, P523, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00820.x; Tian J.

Despite benefits, there are significant barriers to implement and sustain solar PV systems because of inadequate understanding of the feedback between adoption, diffusion, and implementation processes in resource poor communities of low and middle income countries. We analyze the social-behavioral and solar lamp assembly and distribution processes involved in implementing a million solar lamps in rural India and present a novel system dynamics framework to understand solar lamp technology implementation in India and other countries of South Asia. Our framework of three inter-locked subsystems Localization, Affordability, and Saturation - explains how localization, affordability, and saturation emerge from a structure of feedback mechanisms and interact to drive adoption and sustained use of solar PV systems in resource poor communities. A system dynamics approach highlights the importance of understanding feedback and interdependence of these factors, provides tangible insights for future decentralized solar lamp and solar home product deployments.\",\"[Venkateswaran, Jayendran] Indian Inst Technol, Ind Engn & Operat Res, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; [Solanki, Chetan Singh] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Energy Sci & Engn, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; [Werner, Kelsey; Yadama, Gautam N.] Boston Coll, Sch Social Work, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA\",\"Yadama, GN (reprint author), Boston Coll, Sch Social Work, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.\",gautam.yadama@bc.edu,,,Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (Government of India); Sir Dorabji Tata Trust; Idea Cellular CSR; Boston College School of Social Work; Boston College's Schiller Institute for Integrated Science and Society,\"The research is supported by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (Government of India), Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, Idea Cellular CSR, Boston College School of Social Work, and Boston College's Schiller Institute for Integrated Science and Society.

The novelty of proposed HFSG is that the improvement of handling capacity for various uncertainties can facilitate to generate a practical landscape scale planning and water resources management (land-water plan) with a more robust manner. It not only has advantage of reflecting the meteorological impact (e.g., precipitation) presented as probability distribution, but also identifies natural or artificial vagueness in the process of decision-making. Moreover, Green-Z scenario analysis associated with the risk-averse attitude, threshold of acceptability and coefficient of robustness can discern the tradeoff between expected targets and outcomes under different risk preferences of decision makers. Through the application of proposed HFSG model in a practical land-water plan issue, numbers of results associated with optimized planting scales (including cultivation withdraw and forest recovery), stresses of water and land resources, pollutant mitigations, ecological effects and system benefits under varied Green-Z scenarios can be obtained. The results can support policymaker to produce cleaner strategies for alleviating conflict between irrigated activities and environmental protection, achieving socio-economic and eco-environmental sustainability.

Abo\",,,Economic efficiency of small mobile desalination system powered by renewable energy in Egypt,DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Economic efficiency; Small mobile desalination system; Renewable energy; Egypt,,\"Egypt is experiencing a fresh water crisis. Many large and small communities in Egypt are suffering an acute shortage of fresh water that complies with minimum health requirements. Many desert areas require high investment funds to provide them with pure, drinkable water. Some of these areas face a wide range of technical and administrative problems that hinder the achievement of this goal. This research focuses on the integration of saline water and RO water desalination and hybrid solar photovoltaic (PV) technology. Solar driven reverse osmosis desalination can potentially break the dependence of conventional desalination on fossil fuels, reduce operational costs, and improve environmental sustainability. The research is based on an RO-PV driven prototype previously developed and successfully tested by the research team. The aim here is to determine the performance of the desalination unit, to measure their technical, allocative, and economic efficiencies. The data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach is used to estimate the technical, allocative, and economic efficiencies of desalination unit in the North West cost of Egypt. Overall technical, allocative and economic efficiency (EE) measures estimated from the DEA approach and their frequency distributions with constant return to scale (CRS) and variable return to scale (VRS) are presented. Under the CRS assumption, the estimated mean SE measure for desalination unit is 86%. With the VRS model the mean technical efficiency (TE) was estimated to be 94%. The mean allocative efficiency (AE) and EE measures estimated from the DEA frontier are 93%, 87% for CRS, and 96%, 94% for VRS, respectively, indicating that costs could be reduced by approximately 7%, if the unit was allocatively efficient. The mean TE estimated for the desalination unit for the CRS and VRS, DEA approaches are 93% and 98%. This result means that the small unit could produce the same level of output at approximately 7% less cost if the operation was technically efficient if CRS is assumed, or by 2% if VRS is assumed.\",\"[Zaid, Dalia E.

Ruka-Kuusamo in northeastern Finland serves as a case region for the ex ante evaluation. A novel evaluation framework of the study focuses on technical feasibility, institutional context, and potential surplus of LRVT to ecosystem service provision and social capital. The evaluation data from four years action research comprise surveys and group interviews with ecosystem service providers (forest owners) and buyers (tourism entrepreneurs and tourists), complemented with newspaper articles, forest data, and meeting minutes of local authorities. The results show tension between general acceptance and practical readiness to start LRVT. Several institutional challenges need to be solved before adopting LRVT in the region. Ambiguous understanding on the impacts of forest management to landscape and recreation value, deeply institutionalised norms among the forestry community, and hidden agendas may make it difficult to achieve considerable and sustainable improvements in the quality of ecosystem services. This paper concludes with discussing elements of LRVT that may be functional and provide positive returns to recreation values of the area and to social capital inside the community. Several years of research intervention and public discussion have now resettled the network of local actors to a promising position that shows capacity to co-create functional local forest governance, including possibly a publicly or privately organised LRVT system.

The methodology is based on the analyses of chromosome aberrations observed in cells. Therefore, some preliminary research results on the cytogenetic effects on aquatic organisms of various taxa, in coastal, ecosystems are presented, considering some selective regions of elevated natural gamma radiation and conventional pollution. These areas are the geothermal spring areas in the island of Ikaria-Eastern Aegean Sea and the port of Pireus, in Greece. The data are compared to the findings recorded in some organisms collected from the North Aegean Sea the early period after the Chernobyl accident. With regard to the different species examined, a first evaluation of the results is made using the reported field findings for the wide area of Chernobyl. The environmental assessment of the studied areas in terms of radiation impact is based on the cytogenetic injuries observed, and evidence of ecosystem disturbance is also pointed out. The final environmental assessment based on the quantified effects observed in the organisms from the studied areas takes into account a published conceptual model of zones of radiation dose rates and the resulting organism responses in a step function scale.

Building upon a social-ecological model, we examined the relationship between physical activity and community health the health status of a defined group of people while accounting for the potential endogeneity of physical activity to health. Methods: We obtained U.S. county-level data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey and the 2014 County Health Ranking Database. We first conducted an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis to examine the relationship between the rate of physical activity and community health measured by the average perceived health score for each county. We then conducted a 2-stage least squares (2SLS) regression analysis to investigate this relationship after accounting for potential endogeneity. Results: Results from the OLS analysis indicated that the rate of physical activity was positively associated with community health. Results from the 2SLS analysis confirmed that the physical activity rate remained positively associated with community health. Conclusions: In line with the social-ecological model, our findings provide the first evidence for the health benefits of county-level physical activity. Our results support extant research that has shown relationships between physical activity and individual-level, health-related outcomes.\",\"[Sato, Mikihiro] James Madison Univ, Hart Sch Hospitality Sport & Recreat Management, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA; [Du, James] Temple Univ, Sch Tourism & Hospitality Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Inoue, Yuhei] Univ Minnesota, Sch Kinesiol, Minneapolis, MN USA\",\"Sato, M (reprint author), James Madison Univ, Hart Sch Hospitality Sport & Recreat Management, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA.\",satomx@jmu.edu,,\"Sato, Mikihiro/0000-0003-3324-2543\",,,,57.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,HUMAN KINETICS PUBL INC,CHAMPAIGN,\"1607 N MARKET ST, PO BOX 5076, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820-2200 USA\",1543-3080,1543-5474,,J PHYS ACT HEALTH,J.

Since 1999, large-scale revegetation activities such as Grain-to-Green Program have been implemented across China's Loess Plateau. However, negative ecohydrological consequences, including streamflow decline and soil drying have emerged. Here we estimate the equilibrium vegetation cover over the Loess Plateau based on an ecohydrological model and assess the water balance under the equilibrium and actual vegetation cover over the past decade. Results show that the current vegetation cover (0.48 on average) has already exceeded the climate-defined equilibrium vegetation cover (0.43 on average) in many parts of the Loess Plateau, especially in the middle-to-east regions. This indicates a widespread overplanting, which is found to primarily responsible for soil drying in the area. Additionally, both the equilibrium vegetation cover and soil moisture tend to decrease under future (i.e., 2011-2050) climate scenarios due to declined atmospheric water supply (i.e., precipitation) and increased atmospheric water demand (i.e., potential evapotranspiration). Our findings suggest that further revegetation on the Loess Plateau should be applied with caution. To maintain a sustainable ecohydrological environment in the region, a revegetation threshold is urgently needed to guide future revegetation activities.\",\"[Zhang, Shuilei; Yang, Dawen; Yang, Yuting; Yang, Hanbo; Lei, Huimin] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yuting] CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fu, Bojie] Chinese Acad Sci, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China\",\"Yang, DW (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.\",yangdw@tsinghua.edu.cn,\"Lei, Huimin/H-9596-2015; Fu, Bojie/B-1493-2009\",\"Lei, Huimin/0000-0002-1175-2334; yang, yuting/0000-0002-4573-1929; Yang, Hanbo/0000-0002-5925-0245\",\"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41661144031, 51025931]\",\"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41661144031 and 51025931).

We present an integrative study of the pasture-woodland landscape of the Swiss Jura Mountains combining methods from natural and social sciences to explore feedback between vegetation dynamics on paddock level, farm-based decision making, and policy decisions on the national political level. Our modeling results show that concomitant climatic and socioeconomic changes advance the loss of open grassland in silvopastoral landscapes. This would, in the longer term, deteriorate the historical wooded pastures in the region, which fulfill important functions for biodiversity and are widely considered as landscapes that deserve protection. Payment for environmental services could counteract this development while respecting historical land-use and ecological boundary conditions. The assessed policy feedback process reveals that current policy processes may hinder the implementation of PES, even though a payment for the upkeep of wooded pasture would generally enjoy the backing of the relevant policy network. To effectively support the upkeep of the wooded pastures in the Jura, concomitant policy changes, such as market deregulation, must also be taken into account.\",\"[Briner, Simon] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Agrifood & Agrienvironm Econ Grp, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Peringer, Alexander; Gillet, Francois; Buttler, Alexandre] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, Lab Ecol Syst ECOS, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Peringer, Alexander] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Landscape Planning & Ecol ILPOE, Stuttgart, Germany; [Seidl, Roman; Widmer, Alexander; Le, Quang Bao; Hirschi, Christian] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Gillet, Francois; Buttler, Alexandre] Univ Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR Chronoenvironm 6249, F-25030 Besancon, France\",,,\"Gillet, Francois/B-6160-2008; Seidl, Roman/G-5943-2012; Huber, Robert/G-4880-2011; Buttler, Alexandre/K-1137-2012; Zone atelier Arc Jurassien, LTER Jurassian Arc/C-1946-2016\",\"Gillet, Francois/0000-0002-3334-1069; Huber, Robert/0000-0003-4545-456X; Le, Quang Bao/0000-0001-8514-1088\",\"Competence Centre Environment and Sustainability of the ETH Domain, Switzerland; State Secretariat for Education and Research in the framework of the COST Action [SER C07.0112, FP0603]\",\"This work was supported by the Competence Centre Environment and Sustainability of the ETH Domain, Switzerland as part of the Mountland project and by the State Secretariat for Education and Research (SER C07.0112) in the framework of the COST Action FP0603.

The Circular Economy, a new economic framework, can be combined with the 6R-based elements of sustainable manufacturing in order to relieve these challenges by establishing a closed loop material flow. To realize this ideal state, a total life cycle cost model (TLCCM) is needed to serve as the primary engineering economic model. Therefore, a framework for such a model is presented that aims to aid stakeholders in making decisions regarding all aspects of the product life cycle. It is intended that these stakeholders use this model in order to challenge the status quo of costly \"\"green\"\"-centric decisions and demand innovation in the overall process in order to realize a net positive total life cycle cost benefit alongside a balanced Triple-Bottom-Line (TBL). To illustrate how the TLCCM can be applied, an application is explored that uses the model to determine post-recovery resource allocation into three closed-loop streams (Recycling, Rernanufacturing, and Reusing). An outlook for future research is then presented.\",\"[Bradley, Ryan; Jawahir, I.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The Boston Area Community Health Survey enrolled 3201 women aged 30-79 years of black, Hispanic, or white race and/or ethnicity. Baseline and 5-year follow-up interviews were completed by 2534 women (conditional response rate, 83.4%). The association between reproductive history factors and population-weighted estimates of LUTS progression and persistence was tested using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS Between baseline and 5-year follow-up, 23.9% women had LUTS progression. In age-adjusted models, women who had delivered >= 2 childbirths had higher odds of LUTS progression, but the association was completely accounted for by vaginal child delivery (eg, 2 vaginal childbirths vs none, multivariable-adjusted odds ratio >= 2.21; 95% CI, 1.46-3.35; P <. 001). No increased odds of LUTS progression were found for women with only 1 vaginal delivery or who only had cesarean section(s). Uterine prolapse was associated with higher odds of LUTS progression (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio = 3.05; 95% CI, 1.43-6.50; P = .004). Gestational diabetes was associated with approximately twice the odds of LUTS progression, but only among younger women (interaction P = .003). CONCLUSION In this cohort study, >= 2 vaginal child deliveries, uterine prolapse, and among younger women, gestational diabetes were robust predictors of LUTS progression. Clinicians should assess the presence of bothersome urinary frequency, urgency, and voiding symptoms among women who have had multiple vaginal childbirths or gestational diabetes.

Recent evidence suggests that being part of a minority negatively impacts an individual's health status. The objective of this study was to compare inactive leisure-time physical activity between the Francophone minority and the Anglophone majority in Canada. METHODS: Data from the fusion of cycles 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 2008 and 2009 of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) were used. The linguistic variable was determined by languages spoken at home, first language learned and still understood, language of interview, and language of preference. Leisure-time physical activity was based on a questionnaire provided during the interview. Factors associated with inactive leisure time were examined using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Francophones were more likely than Anglophones to be physically inactive in their leisure time (49.1% vs. 47.2%). A greater percentage of Francophones had poor self-perceived health, were older, were single, had lower education, had higher rate of unemployment and lived in rural areas compared to Anglophones. When these socio-demographic factors were taken into account, there were no further differences in the likelihood of being inactive between Francophones and Anglophones. CONCLUSION: The Francophone minority in Canada is characterized by socio-demographic factors that have a negative impact on leisure-time physical activity participation.\",\"[Imbeault, Pascal] Univ Ottawa, Behav & Metab Res Unit, Sch Human Kinet, Fac Hlth Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Makvandi, Ewa; Gagnon-Arpin, Isabelle] Univ Ottawa, Reseau Rech Appl Sante Francophones Ontario, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Batal, Malek] Univ Montreal, Fac Med, Dept Nutr, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Imbeault, Pascal; Grenier, Jean; Chomienne, Marie-Helene; Bouchard, Louise] Montfort Hosp Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Bouchard, Louise] Univ Ottawa, Fac Sci Sociales, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Inst Rech Sante Populat, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada\",\"Imbeault, P (reprint author), Univ Ottawa, Behav & Metab Res Unit, 125 Univ St,Room 350, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.\",imbeault@uottawa.ca,,,,,,7.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,CANADIAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOC,OTTAWA,\"1565 CARLING AVE, SUITE 300, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1Z 8R1, CANADA\",4263-08-01 00:00:00,1920-7476,,CAN J PUBLIC HEALTH,Can.

Debate continues regarding the ecological impacts of genetically modified (GM) crops and their coexistence with non-GM crops in Europe. In this debate, quantitative predictions of gene dispersal by pollen are necessary, and as a result numerous plot-to-plot gene flow experiments have been performed with various crops. However, plot-to-plot cross-pollination rates (CPR) depend on spatial configuration of plots, implying that (i) they are difficult to compare among experiments and (ii) functions directly fitted on CPR data are inappropriate for predictions in other spatial contexts. 2. Modelling pollen dispersal via an individual dispersal function (IDF) circumvents these problems by accounting for spatial designs. We detail for oilseed rape how this approach can be used to both estimate an IDF from field data and predict CPR between two neighbouring fields of various sizes and shapes. Predictions were used to investigate the sensitivity of CPR to the family of IDF, the uncertainty in parameter estimates and the effects of field dimensions and isolation distances. 3. We fitted a range of families of IDF, including several types of tails, on previously published data. The best IDF was a fat-tailed power-law function, meaning frequent long-distance dispersal. 4. The choice of IDF appeared crucial when predicting CPR between fields, occasionally being even more important than the distance between fields. Width of the source field and depth of the recipient field were next in importance. When approximated CPR were calculated without considering field dimensions, using distance between field centres gave better performance than field margins. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates the value of IDF for quantitative predictions of pollen flow in variable spatial configurations. A spatially explicit model of agro-ecosystems used to define management rules for the commercial release of GM crops in Europe already employs IDF but underestimates long-distance dispersal for oilseed rape. These new parameter estimates will refine the performance of these models. Moreover, the detailed guidelines for estimating an IDF should encourage such statistical analysis of other dispersal data, enabling comparisons of dispersal data obtained for different environments and species and providing new IDF for management models.\",\"Inst Natl Rech Agron, Unite Biometrie, Unite Rech Forestieres Mediterraneennes, F-84914 Avignon 9, France; Univ Paris 11, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, CNRS, UMR 8079, F-91405 Orsay, France; Inst Natl Rech Agron, Stn Ameliorat Plantes, F-35653 Le Rheu, France\",\"Klein, EK (reprint author), Inst Natl Rech Agron, Unite Biometrie, Unite Rech Forestieres Mediterraneennes, Domaine St Paul, F-84914 Avignon 9, France.\",etienne.klein@avignon.inra.fr,\"Gouyon, Pierre-Henri/A-9603-2013\",,,,\"ANGEVIN F, 2003, P 1 EUR C COEX GEN M, P166; Austerlitz F, 2004, MOL ECOL, V13, P937, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02100.x; Aylor DE, 2003, AGR FOREST METEOROL, V119, P111, DOI 10.1016/S0168-1923(03)00159-X; Beckie HJ, 2003, ECOL APPL, V13, P1276, DOI 10.1890/02-5231; Beringer JE, 2000, J APPL ECOL, V37, P207, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00502.x; Clark JS, 1999, ECOLOGY, V80, P1475, DOI 10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1475:SDNAFP]2.0.CO;2; Clark JS, 2001, AM NAT, V157, P537, DOI 10.1086/319934; Colbach N, 2001, AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON, V83, P255, DOI 10.1016/S0167-8809(00)00175-4; Cresswell JE, 2002, OIKOS, V98, P375, DOI 10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.980302.x; Cresswell JE, 2004, FUNCT ECOL, V18, P861, DOI 10.1111/j.0269-8463.2004.00917.x; Cresswell JE, 2004, J APPL ECOL, V41, P539, DOI 10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00912.x; Desplanque B, 2002, J APPL ECOL, V39, P561, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2664.2002.00736.x; Devaux C, 2005, MOL ECOL, V14, P2269, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02554.x; Eastham K, 2002, 28 EUR ENV AG; Gliddon CJ, 1999, BCPC SYMP SER, P49; Gray AJ, 2004, J APPL ECOL, V41, P1, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2664.2004.00873.x; Hall L, 2000, WEED SCI, V48, P688, DOI 10.1614/0043-1745(2000)048[0688:PFBHRB]2.0.CO;2; Klein EK, 2003, ECOL MONOGR, V73, P131, DOI 10.1890/0012-9615(2003)073[0131:CPDQMM]2.0.CO;2; Lavigne C, 1998, THEOR APPL GENET, V96, P886, DOI 10.1007/s001220050816; LAVIGNE C, 2004, INTROGRESSION GENETI, P353; Meagher T.

Such efforts can be facilitated by the development and application of ecological models that simulate realistic patterns of vegetation change at high latitudes. This paper reviews three classes of ecological models that have been implemented to extrapolate vegetation information in space (e.g. across the Arctic and adjacent domains) and over historical and future periods (e.g. under altered climate and other forcings). These are: (i) equilibrium biogeographical models; (ii) frame-based transient ecosystem models, and (iii) dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). The equilibrium response of high-latitude vegetation to scenarios of increased surface air temperatures projected by equilibrium biogeographical models is for tundra to be replaced by a northward shift of boreal woodland and forests. A frame-based model (ALFRESCO) indicates the same directional changes, but illustrates how response time depends on rate of temperature increase and concomitant changes in moisture regime and fire disturbance return period. Key disadvantages of the equilibrium models are that they do not simulate time-dependent responses of vegetation and the role of disturbance is omitted or highly generalized. Disadvantages of the frame-based models are that vegetation type is modelled as a set unit as opposed to an association of individually simulated plant functional types and that the role of ecosystem biogeochemistry in succession is not explicitly considered. DGVMs explicitly model disturbance (e.g. fire), operate on plant functional types, and incorporate constraints of nutrient availability on biomass production in the simulation of vegetation dynamics. Under changing climate, DGVMs detail conversion of tundra to tree-dominated boreal landscapes along with time-dependent responses of biomass, net primary production, and soil organic matter turnover-which all increase with warming. Key improvements to DGVMs that are needed to portray behaviour of arctic and boreal ecosystems adequately are the inclusion of anaerobic soil processes for inundated landscapes, permafrost dynamics, and moss-lichen layer biogeochemistry, as well as broader explicit accounting of disturbance regimes (including insect outbreaks and land management). Transient simulation of these landscapes can be further tailored to high-latitude processes and issues by spatially interactive, gridded application of arctic/boreal frame-based models and development of dynamic regional vegetation models (DRVMs) utilizing plant functional type schemes that capture the variety of high-latitude environments.\",\"Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; Int Geosphere Biosphere Programme Secretariat, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA\",\"Kittel, TGF (reprint author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.\",,\"Kittel, Timothy/F-2792-2011\",\"Kittel, Timothy/0000-0002-4153-1006; Chapin III, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910\",,,\"Alcamo J, 1996, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V6, P261, DOI 10.1016/S0959-3780(96)00026-X; ALCAMO J, 1994, IMAGE 2 0 INTEGRATED; AUCLAIR AND, 1997, GLOBAL CHANGE ARCTIC, P452; AVISSAR R, 1989, MON WEATHER REV, V117, P2113, DOI 10.1175/1520-0493(1989)117<2113:APOHLS>2.0.CO;2; Barry R.G., 1967, GEOGRAPHICAL B, V9, P79; Bazzaz FA, 1996, GLOBAL CHANGE TERRES, P43; Beerling DJ, 1997, GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR, V6, P439, DOI 10.2307/2997353; Betts RA, 1997, NATURE, V387, P796, DOI 10.1038/42924; Boer GJ, 2000, CLIM DYNAM, V16, P405, DOI 10.1007/s003820050337; BONAN G B, 1992, P404, DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511565489.018; BONAN GB, 1995, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V29, P145, DOI 10.1007/BF01094014; BONAN GB, 1992, NATURE, V359, P716, DOI 10.1038/359716a0; Bonan GB, 1996, CLIM DYNAM, V12, P279, DOI 10.1007/BF00219501; Brown J., 1998, CIRCUMPOLAR ACTIVE L; Bugmann H, 1996, J VEG SCI, V7, P359, DOI 10.2307/3236279; Bugmann HKM, 2000, ECOL APPL, V10, P95, DOI 10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[0095:EFCABA]2.0.CO;2; Cao MK, 1998, NATURE, V393, P249, DOI 10.1038/30460; Chapin FS, 1997, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V35, P449; Chapin FS, 1998, BIOSCIENCE, V48, P45, DOI 10.2307/1313227; Chapin FS, 1996, J VEG SCI, V7, P347, DOI 10.2307/3236278; CHAPIN FS, 2000, SCENARIOS FUTURE BIO; CIAIS P, 1995, J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS, V100, P5051, DOI 10.1029/94JD02847; Claussen M, 1998, GLOB CHANGE BIOL, V4, P549, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2486.1998.t01-1-00122.x; Cole C.

Purpose: The aim was to study the associations between delivery system characteristics and ACO competencies, including centralization strategies to manage organizations, hospital integration with physicians and outpatient facilities, health information technology, infrastructure to monitor community health and report quality, and risk-adjusted 30-day all-cause mortality and case-mixed-adjusted inpatient costs for the Medicare population. Methodology: Panel data (2006-2009) were assembled from Florida and multiple sources: inpatient hospital discharge, vital statistics, the American Hospital Association, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, and other databases. We applied a panel study design, controlling for hospital and market characteristics. Principal Findings: Hospitals that were in centralized health systems or became more centralized over the study period had significantly larger reductions in mortality compared with hospitals that remained freestanding. Surprisingly, tightly integrated hospital-physician arrangements were associated with increased mortality; as such, hospitals may wish to proceed cautiously when developing specific types of alignment with local physician organizations. We observed no statistically significant differences in the growth rate of costs across hospitals in any of the health systems studied relative to freestanding hospitals. Although we observed quality improvement in some organizational types, these outcome improvements were not coupled with the additional desired objective of lower cost growth. This implies that additional changes not present during our study period, potentially changes in provider payment approaches, are essential for achieving the ACO objectives of higher quality of care at lower costs. Practice Implications: Provider organizations implementing ACOs should consider centralizing service delivery as a viable strategy to improve quality of care, although the strategy did not result in lower cost growth.\",\"[Chukmaitov, Askar; Siangphoe, Umaporn] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Healthcare Policy & Res, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Harless, David W.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Econ, Richmond, VA USA; [Bazzoli, Gloria J.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Hlth Adm, Hlth Adm, Richmond, VA USA; [Carretta, Henry J.] Florida State Univ, Div Hlth Affairs, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA\",\"Chukmaitov, A (reprint author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Healthcare Policy & Res, POB 980430, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.\",achukmaitov@vcu.edu; dwharles@vcu.edu; gbazzoli@vcu.edu; henry.carretta@med.fsu.edu; siangphoeu@vcu.edu,,\"Carretta, Henry/0000-0002-1876-352X\",,,,38.0,14.0,14.0,3.0,21.0,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,\"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA\",0361-6274,1550-5030,,HEALTH CARE MANAGE R,Health Care Manage.

For the cyclic parthenogenetic water flea Daphnia, most of this research has focused on the asexual part of the life cycle and induction of male offspring. Even though Daphnia and many other aquatic invertebrates rely on sexual reproduction and subsequent production of dormant eggs to recover from environmentally harsh conditions, much less is known about the effects of toxicants on the sexual reproductive phase. Using fenoxycarb as a model pesticide, we exposed male and female neonate Daphnia magna, under conditions inducing a switch to sexual reproduction, and tested for effects on dormant egg (ephippia) production and sex ratio of parthenogenetic offspring. Subsequently, we assessed whether fenoxycarb exposure affected the quality of the produced dormant eggs and viability of the hatchlings. Our results showed that exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of fenoxycarb caused a sharp decrease in parthenogenetic reproduction, while inducing male offspring. Dormant egg production was marginally negatively affected, but survival and fitness of the hatched individuals were not significantly affected. This indicates that under pesticide stress, surviving adult females invested in sexual reproduction at the expense of parthenogenetic reproduction. Exposure to toxicants during the sexual reproductive phase, could affect the active aquatic phase as well as the dormant phase in natural zooplankton populations. This indicates the need for further ecotoxicological research and development of test protocols taking into account the full life cycle of zooplankton species.\",\"[Navis, Sabine; Waterkeyn, Aline; De Meester, Luc; Brendonck, Luc] Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Charles Deberiotstr 32, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium\",\"Navis, S (reprint author), Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Charles Deberiotstr 32, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.\",Sabine.Navis@kuleuven.be,,,Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT Vlaanderen),\"This research was funded by a Ph.D. grant of the Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT Vlaanderen).

Given the persistent nature of many musculoskeletal conditions self-management is recognised as an important aspect of effective disease management. However, participant recruitment and retention for formal self-management programs is a challenge. Methods: Arthritis SA (Arthritis Foundation of South Australia, a non-profit community health organisation) redesigned a shorter, community-orientated self-management education program delivered by health professionals. The program utilises aspects of the Stanford model of chronic disease self-management and motivational interviewing as well as principles of adult learning to create an effective learning environment. The program aims to guide participants to learn and practise a range of pain management strategies that are known to be effective in improving quality of life. This study used a pre- and post-test (at 6 weeks) design to determine whether this program achieved benefits in self-reported health outcomes. Outcomes that were measured included pain, fatigue, health distress, self-efficacy and communication. Results: A response rate of 47% (n = 102) was achieved and small but statistically significant improvements in mean [s.d.] pain scores (6.1 [2.3] to 5.4 [2.4], P = 0.001), health distress (2.3 [1.3] to 2.0 [1.3], P = 0.002) and self-efficacy (6.2 [2.1] to 6.8 [2.2], P = 0.002) were found. Conclusion: Community-based participants of this shorter, focused program recorded small but significant improvements in self-reported pain, health distress and self-efficacy. For those who completed the current program, Arthritis SA is currently exploring the potential of developing a booster session to promote sustainable positive health outcomes. So what? Supporting self-management through education is recognised as important but also as a key challenge for effective management of musculoskeletal conditions. Using a pre-post evaluation design, this study demonstrated effectiveness (short-term improvements for self-reported pain, health distress and self-efficacy) for a redesigned and shortened community-targeted program focusing on musculoskeletal pain.\",\"[Hoon, Elizabeth] Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Mail Drop DX 650 205, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Smith, Karen; Black, Julie] Arthritis SA, 118 Richmond Rd, Marleston, SA 5033, Australia; [Burnet, Simon; Hill, Catherine] Queen Elizabeth Hosp, Rheumatol Unit, 28 Woodville Rd, Woodville, SA 5011, Australia; [Hill, Catherine; Gill, Tiffany K.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Med, Med Sch South, Level 3, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia\",\"Hoon, E (reprint author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Mail Drop DX 650 205, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.\",Elizabeth.Hoon@adelaide.edu.au,,,,,,19.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,\"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA\",1036-1073,2201-1617,,HEALTH PROMOT J AUST,Health Promot.

The total Tl concentrations were in the range of 0.506 -0.770 mu g/g and correlated significantly with clay and total organic carbon (TOC) contents, suggesting that the grain size and TOC were major factors controlling Tl distribution. The sequential extraction performed to indicate Tl speciation and availability in Bohai Bay sediments suggested that Tl occurred mainly in the residual fraction and Tl came mainly from natural input. In the non-residual fractions, Fe -Mn oxide and organic matter fractions accounted for the main portions, suggesting that the labile Tl adsorption was dominated by Fe-Mn oxides and organic matter. In addition, according to our estimate, about 2.7 t/yr and 0.16 t/yr of Tl reached Bohai Bay via rivers and atmosphere, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To address this currently missing exposure pathway in life cycle assessment (LCA), we developed a modeling framework for quantifying exposure of bystanders to pesticide spray drift from agricultural fields. Our framework consists of three parts addressing: (1) loss of pesticides from an agricultural field via spray drift; (2) environmental fate of pesticide in air outside of the treated field; and (3) exposure of bystanders to pesticides via inhalation. A comparison with measured data in a case study on pesticides applied to potato fields shows that our model gives good predictions of pesticide air concentrations. We compared our bystander exposure estimates with pathways currently included in LCA, namely aggregated inhalation and ingestion exposure mediated via the environment for the general population, and general population exposure via ingestion of pesticide residues in consumed food crops. The results show that exposure of bystanders is limited relative to total population exposure from ingestion of pesticide residues in crops, but that the exposure magnitude of individual bystanders can be substantially larger than the exposure of populations not living in the proximity to agricultural fields. Our framework for assessing bystander exposure to pesticide applications closes a relevant gap in the exposure assessment included in LCA for agricultural pesticides. This inclusion aids decision-making based on LCA as previously restricted knowledge about exposure of bystanders can now be taken into account. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The key advantage of LCA is its higher product resolution but it relies on global or regional averages, which could bias results. Our outcomes suggest that this obstacle could be avoided for primary goods if domestic process data are collected, since the necessary raw materials are mostly extracted from the environment of the direct trade partner. Conversely, for many other products, intermediate inputs are produced following a wide range of blueprints and cross multiple borders, which makes it challenging to determine how and where raw materials needed for their production originate. For these products, a method to combine the superior coverage of MRIO with the product resolution of LCA is evaluated here, using imports to Finland as a study case. The analysis provides insights on how to identify critical supply chains and illustrates a relatively simple, replicable solution that can be used in other regions or environmental accounts. Nevertheless, the existing resolution of MRIO models and dissimilarities in classifications between the two tools could constitute a new source of errors if not properly handled.\",\"[Pinero, Pablo; Pongracz, Eva] Univ Oulu, Fac Technol, Energy & Environm Engn, POB 4300, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Cazcarro, Ignacio; Arto, Inaki] Univ Basque Country, BC3, Sede Bldg 1,1st Floor,Sci Campus, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Cazcarro, Ignacio] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Agrifood Inst Aragon IA2, ARAID Aragonese Agcy Res & Dev Researcher, Zaragoza, Spain; [Maenpaa, Ilmo; Juutinen, Artti] Univ Oulu, Oulu Business Sch, Dept Econ, POB 4600, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Maenpaa, Ilmo] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, POB 140, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland; [Juutinen, Artti] Nat Resources Inst Finland, POB 413, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland\",\"Pinero, P (reprint author), Univ Oulu, Fac Technol, Energy & Environm Engn, POB 4300, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland.\",Pablo.Pinero@oulu.fi,,\"Arto, Inaki/0000-0001-6427-7437\",University of Oulu Graduate School; AURORA Doctoral Programme,We are grateful to the anonymous reviewer for helpful comments.

The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) was proposed as a sustainable dietary model, due to its nutritional, environmental, economic and sociocultural dimensions. However, further evidence is needed. Thus, our objective was to evaluate the impact on resource (land, water and energy) use and GHG emission of better adherence to the MedDiet in a Mediterranean Spanish cohort. Design: We analysed the dietary pattern of participants through a validated FFQ. The outcomes were land use, water and energy consumption and GHG emission according to MedDiet adherence. The specific environmental footprints of food item production and processing were obtained from different available life-cycle assessments. Setting: Spanish university graduates. Subjects: Participants (n 20 363) in the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort. Results: Better adherence to the MedDiet was associated with lower land use (-0.71 (95% CI -0.76, -0.66) m(2)/d), water consumption (-58.88 (95% CI -90.12, -27.64) litres/d), energy consumption (-0.86 (95% CI -1.01, -0.70) MJ/d) and GHG emission (-0.73 (95% CI -0.78, -0.69) kg CO(2)e/d). A statistically significant linear trend (P<0.05) was observed in all these analyses.

Here, the urban system comprises of urban forests and population, along with different development activities and associated pollution. In addition to equilibrium points and their stabilities, the qualitative behavior of the model system is also being established by determining the uniform persistence. However, quantitative behavior is being predicted through numerical solutions of the model system. The obtained behaviors demonstrate that unplanned development and its associated excessive pollution can disturb the stability of the urban system. It is also being revealed that overexploitation of forest resources by population and devastation of forest resources, as well as of population, through pollutants concentration may also pose a serious threat for a sustainable urban system in the long time. Recommendations for Resource Managers The sustainability of an urban system in the presence of haphazard development activities and excessive pollution is a matter of great concern as it may lead to extinction of urban forests as well as of urban population. The admissible amount of control over urban development through government intervention is necessary for the orderly development of urban areas in harmony with natural environment. This would also help in protecting forest resources and, therefore, on the survival of its dependent population. Urban forestry should be practiced, where emphasis should be on plantation of such vegetation, trees, and shrubs, etc., which have the pollution tolerating and mitigating abilities. In order to establish sustainable urban system, urban development activities should harmonize the people and the environment, while taking proper advantage of abundant natural resources.\",\"[Jyotsna, Kumari; Tandon, Abhinav] BIT, Dept Math, Ranchi 835215, Bihar, India\",\"Tandon, A (reprint author), BIT, Dept Math, Ranchi 835215, Bihar, India.\",abhinav.abhi02@gmail.com,,,,,,20.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,\"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA\",0890-8575,1939-7445,,NAT RESOUR MODEL,Nat.

A simulation model is developed under Microsoft ExcelTM (Microsoft Corporation, Washington, US) to reproduce the flow of returnable transport items (RTIs) in the CLSC and to compute the corresponding environmental impact. Multi-objective optimization, including some relevant environmental key performance indicators (KPIs), is then carried out exploiting the commercial software ModeFRONTIERTM (ESTECO S.p.A., Trieste, Italy), to determine the settings that minimize emissions of the CLSC. In addition, economic and strategic metrics are taken into account in the optimization, to make the analysis more comprehensive. Three scenarios are considered (one \"\"base\"\" scenario and two scenarios examined in a sensitivity analysis) with different relative importance assigned to the metrics subject to optimization. Results show that the asset retrieving operations contribute to the environmental impact of the system to the greatest extent, mainly because of the quite relevant distance between Company A and its customers. Conversely, emissions due to the purchase of new assets contribute to the total environmental impact of the system to a very limited extent. Because the analysis is grounded on a real CLSC, the results are expected to provide practical indications to logistics and supply chain managers, to minimize the environmental performance of the system.\",\"[Bottani, Eleonora; Casella, Giorgia] Univ Parma, Dept Engn & Architecture, Viale GP Usberti 181-A, I-43124 Parma, Italy\",\"Bottani, E (reprint author), Univ Parma, Dept Engn & Architecture, Viale GP Usberti 181-A, I-43124 Parma, Italy.\",eleonora.bottani@unipr.it; giorgia.casella@studenti.unipr.it,,,Italian Ministry of University and Research under the SIR (Scientific Independence of young Researchers);  [D92115000210008];  [RBSI14L97M],\"This research was supported by the research Grant No. D92115000210008 (project code RBSI14L97M), called \"\"ESCALATE Economic and Environmental Sustainability of Supply Chain and Logistics with Advanced Technologies\"\", funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research under the SIR (Scientific Independence of young Researchers) 2014 program (decree of 23 January 2014, No. 197) and awarded to the first author.\",,48.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,MDPI AG,BASEL,\"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND\",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2018.0,10,2,,,,,,,329,10.3390/su10020329,,,,20.0,GREEN & SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FX3BB,WOS:000425943100052,,gold,,,2018-07-06\n",

Therefore, the efficient, equitable, and sustainable allocation of water is vital for water management authorities. With sustainability (guaranteeing the minimum ecological water needs) as the constraint, the paper aims to enhance the water management by considering equity and efficiency. A multi-objective programming model is built with the first objective being to maximize the economic benefit efficiency to allow for the development of improved water allocation strategies and with the second objective being to maximize water allocation equity (measured using the Gini coefficient). A Compromise Programming (CP) method is employed to trade off economic benefit efficiency and equity in the water allocation, which can provide relatively flexible choices and trade-offs according to the decision makers' preferences. The presented model is applied to the Qujiang river basin in China as a case study to demonstrate its feasibility, validity, and practicality, the results from which indicate the trade-off between equity and economic benefit efficiency in the model was feasible, and the conclusions are that river basin authorities need to take measures to decrease the rate of water loss and increase the available water to enhance water allocation efficiency and equity.

Design/methods: In the context of a cluster-randomized controlled trial of two models for community-based management of malaria and/or non-severe pneumonia in children under 5 years old, CHWs in the intervention arm were trained to use RDTs, follow a simple algorithm for classification and treat malaria with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and pneumonia with amoxicillin. CHW records were reviewed to assess the ability of the CHWs to appropriately classify and treat malaria and pneumonia, and account for supplies. Patients were also followed up to assess treatment safety. Results: During the 12-month study, the CHWs evaluated 1017 children with fever and/or fast/difficult breathing and performed 975 RDTs. Malaria and/or pneumonia were appropriately classified 94-100% of the time. Treatment based on disease classification was correct in 94-100% of episodes. Supply management was excellent with over 98% of RDTs, amoxicillin, and AL properly accounted for. The use of RDTs, amoxicillin, and AL was associated with few minor adverse events. Most febrile children (90%) with negative RDT results recovered after being treated with an antipyretic alone.

CSA programs are an important option for sustainable production and consumption. It helps growers generate income (improve financial security) and consumers obtain fresh local foods. Sustaining and growing CSA participation is critical in order to continue enjoying these benefits. We used a national online survey in conjunction with discrete choice models to investigate the impact of demographic characteristics, lifestyle preferences, and different information outlets on the probability that a consumer is or will become a CSA member. The results indicate that the factors affecting current and future CSA participation differ substantially. While none of the demographic characteristics has a significant impact on current CSA participation, some of them significantly affect the probability that a consumer will become a CSA member in the future. Lifestyle preferences have a significant impact on current and future CSA participation. Although none of the information outlets examined affect current CSA participation, word-of-mouth and online sources significantly influence the probability that a consumer will join a CSA program in the future. These findings may have important implications for policy makers' and CSA farm managers' efforts to sustain future CSA development.\",\"[Vassalos, Michael; Zhang, Lisha] Clemson Univ, Dept Agr Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Gao, Zhifeng] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA\",\"Gao, ZF (reprint author), Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.\",mvassal@clemson.edu; zfgao@ufl.edu; lishaz@clemson.edu,,,USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [1001888],\"The authors would like to thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

However, despite the often-stated potential of agroforestry, quantitative data on the benefits of shade trees are limited to relatively few cropping systems, particularly maize and coffee. Furthermore, agroforests are not cost-free and the benefits of agroforests might not be sufficient to outweigh these costs in all cropping systems or environments. Here we quantify costs and benefits of agroforests for cocoa production in Ghana, West Africa. Specifically, we quantified the ability of shade trees to increase soil carbon stocks and soil fertility (i.e. total soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, available phosphorus and potassium, cation exchange capacity, soil aggregation, pH, and foliar nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations), and investigate if these benefits are sufficient to outweigh the negative effects of shade trees on cocoa growth and yields. We measured cocoa yields, soil fertility and carbon-sequestration under individual shade trees, and in 30 x 30 m plots that were distributed along a gradient of shade-tree cover (plot-scale). We found localized positive effects of individual shade trees on soil carbon and nitrogen content, as well as soil aggregation. However, we found no evidence for positive effects of agroforests via improved soil fertility or carbon sequestration with increasing shade-tree cover at the plot scale, a scale that more closely matches the scale at which agroforests are managed. Cocoa growth was lower under individual shade trees and decreased with increasing shade-tree cover in plots, and cocoa yields also decreased with increasing shade-tree cover. Our results indicate that the benefits of agroforestry for soil fertility and carbon sequestration in cocoa cultivation systems might not be as extensive as believed, and may not be sufficient to compensate for short-term costs to production.\",\"[Blaser, W.

These long-term trends might be obscured by smaller, rapid changes in soil C due to seasonal inputs of plant residues, roots, and exudates, or decomposition of such inputs. Yet there is little, if any, data describing the magnitude of seasonal changes in soil C. If seasonal fluctuations in soil C are substantial, then important implications exist for accurate comparison of soil C between sites, between treatments, and even in the same experimental unit over time. Thirty-nine consecutive monthly soil samples were taken from a field experiment planted every year with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the Pacific Northwest, United States. The variation in soil organic C was 14 to 16% of the mean over the 39-mo period in the top 250 kg m(-2) equivalent mass (similar to 0- to 20-cm depth). Two to eight percent could be identified as a regular seasonal pattern. The no-till management system had the greatest seasonal fluctuation, and the timing of the annual maximum was different from that of the tilled soil management treatments. In the shallower soil layer (similar to 0-7 cm), total soil organic C varied 12 to 29% in which 4 to 13% could be attributed to a 12-mo seasonal pattern. Given the small magnitude of changes in soil C being measured and modeled in many agricultural and natural systems, soil samples taken at a single point in time are likely to encounter substantial but hidden measurement variability. The variability may be compounded by factors of the timing of sampling in relation to natural soil organic matter cycles and differences in the cycle due to treatment and weather. Sampling plans, which account for seasonal fluctuation and the different fluctuation patterns under different soil situations, will improve measurement accuracy.\",\"ARS, USDA, Adams, OR 97810 USA\",\"Wuest, S (reprint author), ARS, USDA, 48037 Tubbs Ranch Rd, Adams, OR 97810 USA.\",Stewart.Wuest@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,26.0,12.0,12.0,1.0,26.0,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,\"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA\",0361-5995,1435-0661,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

A building stock model (BSM) is a method of assessing the energy demand and GHG emissions of building stocks and developing pathways for energy and GHG emission reduction. The most common approach to building stock modeling is to construct archetypes that are taken to representing large segments of the stock. This paper introduces a new method of building stock modeling based on the generation of synthetic building stocks. By drawing on relevant research, the developed methodology uses aggregate national data and combines it with various data sources to generate a disaggregated synthetic building stock. The methodology is implemented and validated for the residential building stock of Switzerland. The results demonstrate that the energy demand and GHG emissions can vary greatly across the stock. These and other indicators vary significantly within common building stock segments that consider only few attributes such as building type and construction period. Furthermore, the results indicate a separation of the stock in terms of GHG emissions between old fossil fuel-heated buildings and new and refurbished buildings that are heated by renewable energy. Generating a disaggregated synthetic building stock allows for a discrete representation of various building states. This enables a more realistic representation of past building stock alterations, such as refurbishment, compared with commonly used archetypes, and not relying on more extensive data sources and being able to accommodate a wide variation of data types. The developed methodology can be extended in numerous manners and lays groundwork for future studies. (C) 2018 The Authors.

China's sludge production rate is still low compared with developed countries but is undergoing a rapid growth due to increasing urbanization. Sludge management requires a systematic solution which integrates environmental effectiveness, social acceptability, and economic affordability based on a life cycle approach. In this study, we assess the environmental and economic performance of hydrothermal-pyrolysis technology (HPT), an emerging technology for sludge disposal. Climate change, human toxicity, costs, beneficial use of sludge and land occupation are used as indicators to compare HPT with conventional disposal methods, including incineration with two water contents, landfill, and compost. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) model based on the LCA results (PSO-LCA) was built to find a sustainable sludge management system in Xiamen. HPT was the most favorable scenario for sludge disposal overall, but given capacity restrictions and a trade-off between indicators, the optimal disposal proportion was for landfill to account for 9.3% of total sludge disposal, incineration with water content of 80% to account for 35.9%, HPT to account for 28.9% and compost to account for the remaining 25.9%. As further dewatering contributes a significant fraction to human toxicity effects and economic performance, the amount of dewatering should be selected based on the subsequent disposal process. The PSO-LCA method provides scientific evidence to inform decision makers to find a sustainable sludge management plan in accordance with wastewater features and socioeconomic conditions in Chinese cities.

These transformations will have immediate impacts on various of the sustainable development goals. As goals such as affordable and clean energy and zero hunger are more immediate to great parts of global population, these impacts are central for societal acceptability of climate policies. Yet, little is known about how the achievement of other social and environmental sustainability objectives can be directly managed through emission reduction policies. In addition, the integrated assessment literature has so far emphasized a single, global (cost-minimizing) carbon price as the optimal mechanism to achieve emissions reductions. In this paper we introduce a broader suite of policies-including direct sector-level regulation, early mitigation action, and lifestyle changes-into the integrated energy-economy-land-use modeling system REMIND-MAgPIE. We examine their impact on non-climate sustainability issues when mean warming is to be kept well below 2 degrees C or 1.5 degrees C. We find that a combination of these policies can alleviate air pollution, water extraction, uranium extraction, food and energy price hikes, and dependence on negative emissions technologies, thus resulting in substantially reduced sustainability risks associated with mitigating climate change. Importantly, we find that these targeted policies can more than compensate for most sustainability risks of increasing climate ambition from 2 degrees C to 1.5 degrees C.\",\"[Bertram, Christoph; Luderer, Gunnar; Popp, Alexander; Stevanovic, Miodrag; Humpenoeder, Florian; Giannousakis, Anastasis; Kriegler, Elmar] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Leibniz Assoc, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Minx, Jan Christoph; Lamb, William F.] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Minx, Jan Christoph] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England\",\"Bertram, C (reprint author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Leibniz Assoc, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.\",bertram@pik-potsdam.de,,,German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) under UFOPLAN FKZ [371441 1670],\"The authors thank Sabine Fuss and Eric Fee for helpful comments during a workshop presentation at MCC, and Aman Malik for helpful comments on the draft text.

One would therefore anticipate that there is some degree of linkage between these two compartments. Recent work has shown that respiration in the light is higher than dark respiration. Consequently, many of the methods used to determine respiration and production are biased as they require the assumption that light and dark respiration rates are equivalent. We show here that, in a coastal ecosystem, under visible light exposure, respiration in the light is related to gross production. More than 60% of the variation of respiration in the light, measured at 1 to 40 A mu g L(-1) of chlorophyll a (Chla), could be explained by the variations of gross production. Secondly, the relative contribution of bacterial respiration to community respiration in the light represented up to 79% at low Chla (1 A mu g L(-1)) and was negatively correlated with Chla concentration. Although bacterial production and bacterial respiration were both enhanced in the light, bacterial respiration in the light was more stimulated than bacterial production, which resulted in a decrease in bacterial growth efficiency during light exposure. These results show that the impact of light on the functioning of the microbial loop needs to be taken into account for a better understanding of the oceanic carbon cycle.\",\"[Pringault, Olivier; Tesson, Sylvie; Rochelle-Newall, Emma] Ctr IRD Noumea, UR CAMELIA 103, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Rochelle-Newall, Emma] Univ Montpellier 2, UR CAMELIA 103, UMR ECOLOG 5119, F-34095 Montpellier, France\",\"Pringault, O (reprint author), Univ Montpellier 2, UR CAMELIA 103, UMR ECOLOG 5119, Stn Mediterraneenne Environm Littoral, 1 Quai Daurade, F-34200 Sete, France.\",Olivier.Pringault@ird.fr,\"Tesson, Sylvie/D-9018-2015; Pringault, Olivier/A-7399-2008\",\"Tesson, Sylvie/0000-0002-0751-6953; Pringault, Olivier/0000-0003-2363-8376; Rochelle-Newall, Emma/0000-0003-0951-8650\",French Institute for Research for Development (IRD); French national program of coastal environment (PNEC); national program of ecotoxicology (PNETOX); French Ministry of Overseas Territories (MOM),\"This work was supported by the French Institute for Research for Development (IRD), by the French national program of coastal environment (PNEC), by the national program of ecotoxicology (PNETOX), and by the French Ministry of Overseas Territories (MOM).

However, there is only limited research on how to link the empowerment approach to the promotion of healthy eating, which is a major current public health issue. The article presents the development of a study framework for implementing and evaluating an empowerment intervention for healthy nutrition. This framework was created for a community intervention study meaning to involve elderly citizens in Bavaria, Germany. The study protocol was developed in an iterative process basing on (i) literature reviews on the topics empowerment in relation to healthy nutrition and mixed-methods evaluation, (ii) workshops with empowerment and public health experts and (iii) consultations with local community representatives. Through these measures we identified good practice criteria as well as specific challenges of integrating empowerment and healthy nutrition, e.g. engaging people in healthy nutrition, reconciling participants' nutrition preferences with public health nutrition priorities and evaluating bottom-up activities in the community. Consequences for the study design were deducted from the literature and the consultations, e.g. practical recommendations as to how power could be gradually assigned to group members. A qualitative mixed-method evaluation design was chosen to capture emergent empowerment processes. The study framework presented here is the first on empowerment and nutrition to provide explicit guidance on how empowerment may be applied to healthy nutrition and implemented and evaluated in the community context.\",\"[Brandstetter, Susanne; Curbach, Janina; Lindacher, Verena; Rueter, Jana; Warrelmann, Berit; Loss, Julika] Univ Regensburg, Med Sociol, Dr Gessler Str 17, D-93051 Regensburg, Germany\",\"Loss, J (reprint author), Univ Regensburg, Med Sociol, Dr Gessler Str 17, D-93051 Regensburg, Germany.\",julika.loss@ukr.de,,,German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [0315849],This work was supported by a grant from the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) ('Innovations in Nutrition') [grant number 0315849].,,47.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,\"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND\",0957-4824,1460-2245,,HEALTH PROMOT INT,Health Promot.

The widely accepted explanation to this observation is a viewpoint of anthropogenic impacts on the and environmental ecosystem across the border. In order to examine the validity of this viewpoint, three methods were employed in this study to determine the quantitative structure of main land cover patterns (biogenic crust, bare sand, vegetation and playa) in the and region: field observation, measurement on aerial photograph, and analysis of vegetation cover changes on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and SPOT images. Field observation on the Israeli side indicated that vegetation covers similar to 16% of the ground, biogenic crust similar to 69%, sand similar to 12% and playa 3%. Evidence from aerial photograph supported a sharp contrast of vegetation cover across the border, with similar to 17% on the Israeli side and similar to 6% on the Egyptian side. Analysis of the available TM/SPOT images indicated a high vibration of seasonal vegetation changes in the region. The Israeli side had a vegetation cover rate ranging from above 18% in the growing season and below 5% in the dry months. The rate on the Egyptian side changes from less than 2% in the dry season to similar to 5% in the growing season. Therefore, it is reasonable to estimate surface composition structure of the region as follows: vegetation, biogenic crust, bare sand and playa account for 5-18%, 71-84%, 7.5% and 3.5%, respectively, on the Israeli side, and 2-5%, 12.5%, 79-82% and 3.5% on the Egyptian side, depending on the season. This estimate of land cover structure has been successfully used to model land surface temperature differences across the border, in order to understand and ecosystem evolution in the region.

This limited understanding creates a gap between what accountants can do and what accountants should do to assist in Big Data information governance. The study aims to bridge this gap in two ways. Design/methodology/approach-First, the study introduces a model of the Big Data life cycle to explain the process of converting Big Data into information. Knowledge of this life cycle is a first step toward enabling accountants to engage in Big Data information governance. Second, it highlights informational and control risks inherent to this life cycle, and identifies information governance activities and agents that can minimize these risks. Findings-Because accountants have a strong ability to identify the informational and control needs of internal and external decision-makers, they should play a significant role in Big Data information governance. Originality/value-This model of the Big Data life cycle and information governance provides a first attempt to formalize knowledge that accountants need in a new field of the accounting profession.\",\"[Coyne, Emily M.] San Jose State Univ, Sch Informat, Jose State, CA USA; [Coyne, Joshua G.; Walker, Kenton B.] Univ Memphis, Sch Accountancy, Memphis, TN 38152 USA\",\"Coyne, JG (reprint author), Univ Memphis, Sch Accountancy, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.\",jgcoyne@memphis.edu,,,Fogelman College of Business & Economics at the University of Memphis,This work was supported in part by a grant from the Fogelman College of Business & Economics at the University of Memphis.,,65.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,\"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND\",1834-7649,1758-9037,,INT J ACCOUNT INF MA,Int.

In this study, we simulated and examined the possible future LULC patterns and changes in Munessa-Shashemene landscape of the Ethiopian highlands covering four decades (2012-2050) using a spatially explicit GIS-based model. Both primary and secondary sources were utilized to identify relevant explanatory variables (drivers) and LULC datasets for the model. Three alternative scenarios, namely Business As Usual (BAU), Forest Conservation and Water Protection (FCWP) and Sustainable Intensification (SI) were used. The simulated LULC map of 2012 was compared with the actual for model validation and showed a good consistency. The results revealed that areas of croplands will increase widely under the BAU scenario and would expand to the remaining woodlands, natural forests and grasslands, reflecting vulnerability of these LULC types and potential loss of associated ecosystem service values (ESVs). FCWP scenario would bring competition among other LULC types, particularly more pressure to the grassland ecosystem. Hence, the two scenarios will result in severe LULC dynamics that lead to serious environmental crisis. The SI scenario, with holistic approach, demonstrated that expansion of croplands could vigorously be reduced, remaining forests better conserved and degraded land recovered, resulting in gains of the associated total ESVs. We conclude that a holistic landscape management, i.e. SI, is the best approach to ensure expected production while safeguarding the environment of the studied landscape and elsewhere with similar geographic settings. Further study is suggested to practically test our framework through a research for development approach in a test site so that it can be used as a model area for effective use and conservation of our natural resources.

It acts as a medium for urban design, planning, and management to determine how processes affecting sustainability can operate and interact. Therefore, how spatial heterogeneity is conceptualized and measured in cities is crucial for enhancing sustainability. We show that the two most commonly used, but contrasting paradigms of urban ecology, ecology IN versus ecology OF the city, determine how spatial heterogeneity is thought of and used in different ways. We identify the key implications of these theoretical contrasts for the practice and assessment of sustainability in urban areas. We review and compare the different ways in which ecology IN versus ecology OF the city affect how to conceptualize, model and map urban spatial heterogeneity. We present a new framework to guide the comparison of spatial heterogeneity under the two paradigms. The integrative nature of this new framework becomes apparent under the ecology OF the city paradigm, because it recognizes the hybrid social and bioecological nature of heterogeneity in urban ecosystems. The hybrid approach to patchiness resonates with the three pillars of sustainability-environment, society, and economy. We exemplify how the more comprehensive and integrated framework of spatial heterogeneity under the ecology OF the city paradigm (1) supports more effective measurement and integration of the three components of sustainability, (2) improves management of heterogeneous urban ecosystems, and (3) satisfies calls for improved ecological tools to support urban ecosystem design.\",\"[Zhou, Weiqi] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Pickett, Steward T.

A central challenge for these disciplines is integrating an ever-increasing number of findings into a coherent body of theory. Without a repository for this theory, researchers cannot adequately leverage this knowledge to guide future empirical work. Comparability across field sites, study areas and scientific fields is hampered, as is the progress of sustainability science. To address this challenge we constructed the first repository of theoretical statements linking social and ecological variables to environmental outcomes. Stored in a relational database that is accessible via a website, this repository includes systematically formalized theories produced from researchers studying resilience, environmental conservation, common-pool resource governance, environmental and resource economics and political ecology. Theories are explicitly linked together in the database to form the first coherent expression of the types of human-environment interactions that affect outcomes for natural resources and, by extension, the people who use them. Analysis of this repository shows that a variety of types of theories exist, from the simple to the complex, and that theories tend to thematically cluster by scientific field, although the theories of every field were related in at least some way to theories from other fields. Thus there is much potential for increased interaction across these fields, hopefully with the help of resources such as this repository. The theories and variables employed to express their arguments are publicly viewable in a wiki-like format, as a resource for the scientific community. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study is to develop a Life-Cycle Cost-Benefit Analysis (LC-CBA) framework, through the integration of the life-cycle assessment (LCA) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA), to guide decision-making in sustainable food waste management. The analysis tool assesses the environmental and economic performance of different food waste management options, as demonstrated in a case study of the Hong Kong International Airport with six food waste handling scenarios consisting of different combinations of treatment technologies. Both centralized (i.e., off-site) and on-site treatment options were evaluated. The on-site incineration scenario was found to be the most sustainable option with the lowest life-cycle net costs of HKD 461.73/tonne. The scenario achieved the highest energy recovery of 707 kWh/tonne, which led to an economic savings of HKD 697.81/tonne and an environmental savings of HKD 470.96/tonne. The LC-CBA developed in this study is widely applicable to inform decision-making on sustainable food waste management worldwide. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We present a framework combining life cycle assessment (LCA) and the Cradle to Cradle (R) (C2C) certification program for the development of continuous loop packaging systems, which was conceived for aluminum cans in the context of the Carlsberg Circular Community. As a first step, the environmentally optimal beverage packaging life cycle scenario is identified, both in terms of defined use and reuse. Second, the limiting factors are identified for the continuous use of materials in multiple loops, meeting the two requirements in the C2C certification process that address the material level (i.e., \"\"material health\"\" and \"\"material reutilization\"\" criteria) and the \"\"renewable energy\"\" criterion. Then, alternative scenarios are built to meet C2C certification criteria, and LCA is used to quantify the environmental impacts of the resulting improvement strategies, for example, change in material composition, in order to guide the identification of the optimal scenario from an eco-efficiency point of view. Finally, the business perspective is addressed by assessing the potential for a green value network business model for a closed-loop supply. The outcome is a list of prioritized actions needed to implement the most efficient and effective \"\"upcycling\"\" strategy for the beverage packaging, both from an environmental and an economic point of view. In the case of the aluminum cans, the main recommendation from both the LCA and C2C perspective is to ensure a system that enables can-to-can recycling.\",\"[Niero, Monia; Hauschild, Michael Z.; Olsen, Stig I.] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, Div Quantitat Sustainabil Assessment QSA, Bygninstorvet Bldg 115, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Hoffmeyer, Simon B.] Carlsberg Breweries AS, Grp Corp Affairs, Copenhagen, Denmark\",\"Niero, M (reprint author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, Div Quantitat Sustainabil Assessment QSA, Bygninstorvet Bldg 115, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.\",monni@dtu.dk,,\"Hauschild, Michael Zwicky/0000-0002-8331-7390; Olsen, Stig Irving/0000-0003-4599-7660\",Carlsberg Foundation,\"The authors thank the Carlsberg Foundation for funding the post-doc project \"\"Design of Cradle to Cradle (R)-Inspired System for Beer Beverage Packaging,\"\" as well as all of the people in the Carlsberg Group who were involved in the discussion and data collection, in particular, Hakon Langen, Eskild Andersen, and Renil Manat.

Few models can effectively predict how biocultural livelihoods might be impacted. Here, we examine how environmental and anthropogenic factors influence an ecological niche model (ENM) for the realized niche of cultivated taro (Colocasia esculenta) in Hawaii. We created and tuned two sets of ENMs: one using only environmental variables, and one using both environmental and cultural characteristics of Hawaii. These models were projected under two different Intergovernmental Panelon Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for 2070. Models were selected and evaluated using average omission rate and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We compared optimal model predictions by comparing the percentage of taro plots predicted present and measured ENM overlap using Schoener's D statistic. The model including only environmental variables consisted of 19 Worldclim bioclimatic variables, in addition to slope, altitude, distance to perennial streams, soil evaporation, and soil moisture. The optimal model with environmental variables plus anthropogenic features also included a road density variable (which we assumed as a proxy for urbanization) and a variable indicating agricultural lands of importance to the state of Hawaii. The model including anthropogenic features performed better than the environment-only model based on omission rate, AUC, and review of spatial projections. The two models also differed in spatial projections for taro under anticipated future climate change. Our results demonstrate how ENMs including anthropogenic features can predict which areas might be best suited to plant cultivated species in the future, and how these areas could change under various climate projections. These predictions might inform biocultural conservation priorities and initiatives. In addition, we discuss the incongruences that arise when traditional ENM theory is applied to species whose distribution has been significantly impacted by human intervention, particularly at a fine scale relevant to biocultural conservation initiatives.\",\"[Kodis, Mali'o; Galante, Peter; Sterling, Eleanor J.; Blair, Mary E.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, Cent Pk West & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA\",\"Kodis, M (reprint author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, Cent Pk West & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA.\",mkodis@amnh.org,,,Helen Gurley Brown Trust,\"Funding for this research was provided by a generous grant from the Helen Gurley Brown Trust in the form of a Helen Fellowship for the lead author.

This novel RSM expands as a co-management model for a rural community in resource-constrained environments to manage its resources efficiently in collaboration with local governments. Avenues for sustainable livelihood generation was assessed through household surveys and resource mapping of the village. A mixed-mode research method was adopted through participatory rural appraisal activities for involving local people and their practices in the design philosophy of RSM. Problem identification and ranking through personal and collective interviews of the villagers formed a core basis for the livelihood assessment. It enabled the internalisation of normative and idiosyncratic linkages for resource symbiosis. These linkages were interconnected through community participation, which set the boundary conditions for RSM. Results show that RSM for the study village could foster inclusive growth in two ways: first, by creating scope for efficient resource utilisation through the establishment of an oil mill, a biogas plant and a milk processing unit; and, second, by creating an entrepreneurial ecosystem based on village's selfsufficiency and market demand by empowering local entrepreneurs.

In addition, feedbacks between land cover change and human behavior constrain the extent and trajectories of land transitions. The sustainability of land use systems in the tropics depends on an understanding of coupled human-natural systems that can lead to general frameworks for management and prediction.

Synthetic musk compounds are widely used as additives in personal care and household products. The photochemical degradation of musk tibetene in aqueous solutions or in acetonitrile/water mixtures under different conditions was studied in order to assess its environmental fate. Methods. Musk tibetene dissolved (or suspended) in water and/or acetonitrile/water mixtures was irradiated at different times by UV-light and by solar light. The irradiation mixtures were analyzed by NMR and TLC. The photoproducts formed were identified by GC-MS and NMR data. Results. The experimental results indicated that musk tibetene was photodegradable in water or acetonitrile/water mixtures with half-life reaction times close to 20 minutes. The irradiation mixtures were separated by chromatographic techniques yielding three photoproducts (3,3,5,6,7-pentamethyl-4-nitro-3H-indole, 3,3,5,6,7-pentamethyl-4-nitro-1H-indoline and 3,3,5,6,7-pentamethyl-4-nitro-3H-indolinone) identified by means of spectroscopic analysis. Discussion. The numerical modelling of the photodegradation concentration-time profiles gave (8.13 +/- 0.15).10(-2) and (1.34 +/- 0.04).10(-2) mol/E for the overall primary quantum yield of direct photolysis for musk tibetene and the major intermediate (3,3,5,6,7-pentamethyl-4-nitro-3H-indolinone), respectively, in the wavelength range 305-366 nm. The half-life times of photodegradation of the both substances varied from 1-1.5 hours at 20 degrees N during the summer season to 6-10 hours for highest latitudes in winter. Conclusions. Under solar light, musk tibetene was photolabile in acetonitrile and acetonitrile/water 1/1, while it was slowly degraded when suspended in water. In all media, musk tibetene was photodegraded into three photoproducts. By using a kinetic model, the overall primary quantum yields of direct photolysis of musk tibetene and its main photoproduct, in the wavelength range 305-366 nm, were estimated, indicating that the photodegradation rate for musk tibetene is faster than the photolysis rate of the major by-product. Recommendations and Perspectives. The results indicate that, in order to assess the environmental impact of musk tibetene on the aquatic ecosystem, great attention should be focused on the major photoproduct which is proved to be more persistent than the parent compound under light irradiation. The predicted half-life times of direct photolysis for both substances ranged from 1-1.5 hours at 20 degrees N during the summer season to about 6-10 hours for highest latitudes in winter, indicating that, from a photochemical point of view, the environmental persistence of these substances increases by increasing the latitudes and during the cold seasons, making more realistic an intake of these xenobiotic molecules into the food chain of aquatic living organisms. Tanabe reports in his Editorial (Tanabe 2005) that \"\"It is necessary to have knowledge of the global picture of synthetic musk pathways. So, it is conceivable that now is the time to study the transport, persistency, distribution, bioaccumulation and toxic potential of this new environmental menace on a global scale, especially in developing countries\"\". Therefore, the future environmental analysis and investigations on the eco-toxicity of nitro musk compounds should take into account not only the presence of the parent compounds but also their photochemical intermediates or end-by-products.\",\"[Canterino, Marisa; Marotta, Raffaele] Univ Naples Federico 2, Fac Ingn, Dipartimento Ingn Chim, I-80125 Naples, Italy; [Temussi, Fabio; Zarrelli, Armando] Univ Naples Federico 2, Dipartimento Chim Organ & Biochim, Fac Sci MFN, UdR Napoli Consorzio INCA 4, I-80126 Naples, Italy\",\"Marotta, R (reprint author), Univ Naples Federico 2, Fac Ingn, Dipartimento Ingn Chim, Ple V Tecchio 80, I-80125 Naples, Italy.\",rmarotta@unina.it,\"Zarrelli, Armando/N-4379-2016\",\"Zarrelli, Armando/0000-0001-7866-821X; Marotta, Raffaele/0000-0002-0548-7087\",,,\"Andreozzi R, 2003, CHEMOSPHERE, V50, P1319, DOI 10.1016/S0045-6535(02)00769-5; BISELLI S, 2004, HDB ENV CHEM, P189; Brigante M., 2004, ENVIRON CHEM LETT, V1, P237; Butte W, 1999, CHEMOSPHERE, V38, P1287, DOI 10.1016/S0045-6535(98)00529-3; Carlsson G, 2000, MAR ENVIRON RES, V50, P237, DOI 10.1016/S0141-1136(00)00075-1; Chou YJ, 1999, TOXICOL LETT, V111, P17, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4274(99)00167-8; De Laat J., 1995, P 12 OZ WORLD C INT, P373; DellaGreca M, 2004, CHEMOSPHERE, V54, P629, DOI 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2003.09.008; DOPP D, 1975, CHEM BER-RECL, V108, P3483, DOI 10.1002/cber.19751081108; Draisci R, 1998, J CHROMATOGR A, V814, P187, DOI 10.1016/S0021-9673(98)00396-3; DULIN D, 1982, ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL, V16, P815, DOI 10.1021/es00105a017; Gatermann R, 2002, ARCH ENVIRON CON TOX, V42, P437, DOI 10.1007/s00244-001-0041-2; Gatermann R, 1998, CHEMOSPHERE, V36, P2535, DOI 10.1016/S0045-6535(97)10208-9; Heberer T, 1999, ACTA HYDROCH HYDROB, V27, P150, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1521-401X(199905)27:3<150::AID-AHEH150>3.0.CO;2-H; Heberer Thomas, 2002, Acta Hydrochimica et Hydrobiologica, V30, P227, DOI 10.1002/aheh.200390005; Llompart M, 2003, J CHROMATOGR A, V999, P185, DOI 10.1016/S0021-9673(03)00449-7; MAEKAWA A, 1990, FOOD CHEM TOXICOL, V28, P581, DOI 10.1016/0278-6915(90)90159-K; NAIR J, 1986, FOOD CHEM TOXICOL, V24, P27, DOI 10.1016/0278-6915(86)90260-7; NISHIO T, 1991, J CHEM SOC PERK T 1, P141, DOI 10.1039/p19910000141; OECD, 2000, OECD ENV HLTH SAF PU; Osemwengie LI, 2001, J CHROMATOGR A, V932, P107, DOI 10.1016/S0021-9673(01)01216-X; *OSPAR, 1999, HAZ SUBST SER DOC CO; Paasivirta J, 2002, ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R, V9, P345, DOI 10.1065/espr2001.09.092; Rimkus GG, 1999, TOXICOL LETT, V111, P37, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4274(99)00191-5; Romero J, 2003, WA SCI TECHNOL, V3, P139; Tanabe S, 2005, MAR POLLUT BULL, V50, P1025, DOI 10.1016/j.marpolbul.2005.07.005\",26.0,6.0,6.0,0.0,26.0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,\"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY\",0944-1344,,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

These forests are of seed origin and they regenerate naturally. Therefore, natural forests are the most important forest category from the point of view of timber production, as well as its quality and biodiversity. The natural forests accessibility and overall forest accessibility are insufficient for sustainable forest management. This is the reason for dealing with planning of forest roads, actually planning of forest accessibility and designing of forest roads in this forest category. This task requires quantity and quality analysis of the current forest road network, determination of optimal density of forest roads, determination of suitability of forest area for the construction of forest roads and designing of forest roads in the end. Planning of forest roads is carried out at strategic level. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) allows the selection and evaluation of influential factors related to planning of forest roads. The tools of Geographic Information System (GIS) allow a complete spatial and statistical analysis and management of data collected from the forest management plans or data surveyed in the field and obtained by means of \"\"Digital Terrain Model\"\" (DTM) and AHP method. Planning of forest roads will be done in the Management Unit (MU) \"\"Prosara\"\", located in the northern part of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH). The current density of forest roads is 7.3 m/ha in natural forests of this management unit. The optimal density of forest roads should be 17 m/ha. The length of new forest roads designed in the MU \"\"Prosara\"\" is 21 km, and forest accessibility has increased to 13.5 m/ha.\",\"[Petkovic, Vladimir] Univ Banja Luka, Fac Forestry, Bulevar Vojvode Stepe Stepanovica 75, Banja Luka 78000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Potocnik, Igor] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Jamnikarjeva 101, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia\",\"Petkovic, V (reprint author), Univ Banja Luka, Fac Forestry, Bulevar Vojvode Stepe Stepanovica 75, Banja Luka 78000, Bosnia & Herceg.\",vladimir.petkovic@sfbl.org; igor.potocnik@bf.uni-lj.si,,,,,,48.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,\"ZAGREB UNIV, FAC FORESTRY\",ZAGREB,\"SVETOSIMUNSKA 25, ZAGREB, HRVATSKA 10000, CROATIA\",1845-5719,,,CROAT J FOR ENG,Croat.

This paper develops a life-cycle portfolio-choice model in which the investor experiences loss-averse utility over news and can ignore his portfolio. In such a model, the investor prefers to ignore and not rebalance his portfolio most of the time because he dislikes bad news more than he likes good news such that expected news causes a first-order decrease in utility. Consequently, the investor has a first-order willingness to pay a portfolio manager who rebalances actively on his behalf. Moreover, the investor can diversify over time and his consumption aligns with predictions of mental accounting. I structurally estimate the preference parameters by matching stock shares and stock-market non-participation over the life cycle. My parameter estimates are in line with the literature, generate reasonable intervals of inattention, and simultaneously explain consumption and wealth accumulation over the life cycle. Here, it matters that news utility preserves first-order risk aversion even in the presence of stochastic labor income, which also causes stock shares to rise in wealth.\",\"[Pagel, Michaela] Columbia GSB, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Pagel, Michaela] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Pagel, Michaela] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA\",\"Pagel, M (reprint author), Columbia GSB, New York, NY 10027 USA.; Pagel, M (reprint author), NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.; Pagel, M (reprint author), CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.\",mpagel@columbia.edu,,,Psych-and-Econ group at UC Berkeley,\"I thank Adam Szeidl, Matthew Rabin, Nick Barberis, Ulrike Malmendier, Botond Koszegi, Gur Huberman, Tano Santos, Paul Tetlock, Brett Green, Martin Lettau, John Beshears, James Choi, Keith Chen, Max Kasy, Florian Peters, Aniko Oery, Sheng Li, Ana Rocca, Marco Schwarz, Lydia Ashton, Sebastian Ebert, Takeshi Murooka, Victoria Vanasco as well as seminar participants at Wharton, LBS, Columbia GSB, Yale SOM, University of Toronto, Michigan State University, University of Toronto Rotman, UCLA Anderson, USC Marshall, University of Washington Foster, Federal Reserve Board, and other places for their helpful comments and suggestions.

All the common policies that EU has implemented in the function of competition, expressed in the general form of the Common Market that will help us to better use the factors. Starting from this point of view the answer to eliminate the social problems that exist in our country can be eliminated through Social Economy. Third Sector represents an economic development model that seeks to balance the private and social interests in a free market economy. It represents a third way, which should be accepted (at least partially) by different groups of those who believe in the total market economy and taking into account the role of the state in maintaining the balance mentioned above. Unemployment is a global phenomenon that greatly affects young people, especially those from poor environments, with little education and no work experience. As a response to this situation the European Social Economy has proposed the creation of social enterprises and labor integration. These organizations train young people in the current work environment, so they can recognize the habits and appropriate responsibilities.\",\"Univ Aleksander Moisiu Durres, Fac Business, Durres, Albania\",\"Bezhani, E (reprint author), Univ Aleksander Moisiu Durres, Fac Business, Durres, Albania.\",edabezhani82@gmail.com,,,,,,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,HEALTH & ENVIRONMENT ASSOC,TIRANE,\"HEALTH & ENVIRONMENT ASSOC, TIRANE, 00000, ALBANIA\",2224-4980,,,INT J ECOSYST ECOL S,Int.

Life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) of hydrogen can help the decision-makers/stakeholders to select the most sustainable pathway for hydrogen production in life cycle perspective among several alternatives. This study aims at developing a life cycle sustainability decision-support framework for ranking hydrogen production pathways by combining LCSA and interval multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method. A novel interval MCDM method which can handle interval numbers in the decision-making matrix was developed by combining the improved decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and interval evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS). Four pathways for hydrogen production, including coal gasification (CG), stream reforming of methane (SMR), biomass gasification (BG), and wind turbine electrolysis (WEL), have been studied by the proposed method. BG was recognized as the most sustainable one among these four scenarios, following by SMR, WEL, and CG in the descending order. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate the effects of the weights of the indicators for sustainability assessment on the final ranking. The interval sum weighted method (ISWM) and interval TOPSIS method were also employed to validate the results determined by the proposed interval EDAS in this study and the results reveal that BG was recognized as the most sustainable scenario by all these three methods.

Given the variabilities in key parameters (e.g., service life of products and annual release rate during use) nanoRelease is designed as a stochastic model. We apply nanoRelease to three ENMs (TiO2, SiO2 and FeOx) used in paints and coatings through seven product applications, including construction and building, household and furniture, and automotive for the period from 2000 to 2020 using production volume and market projection information. We also consider model uncertainties using Monte Carlo simulation. Compared with 2016, the total annual releases of ENMs in 2020 will increase by 34-40%, and the stock will increase by 28-34%. The fraction of the end-of-life release among total release flows will increase from 11% in 2002 to 43% in 2020. As compared to static models, our dynamic model predicts about an order of magnitude lower values for the amount of ENM released from this sector in the near-term while stock continues to build up in the system.\",\"[Song, Runsheng; Qin, Yuwei; Suh, Sangwon; Keller, Arturo A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA\",\"Suh, S; Keller, AA (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.\",suh@bren.ucsb.edu; keller@bren.ucsb.edu,,\"Suh, Sangwon/0000-0001-8290-6276; Keller, Arturo/0000-0002-7638-662X\",U.S. Environmental Protection Agencies Science to Achieve Results (STAR) [83557907]; National Science Foundation (NSF); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [NSF-EF0830117],\"We acknowledge the financial support of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencies Science to Achieve Results (STAR) Program under Grant No. 83557907 and the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under NSF-EF0830117.
